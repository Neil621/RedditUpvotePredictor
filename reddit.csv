"I ordered several grams of GTS-21 from a very well-regarded supplier commonly known to this community.  It was a bit costly but smaller sizes were out of stock and I had heard favorable things about it from others.

GTS-21 is an intensely yellow light-to-moderate-weight powder, with a strong tendency to stain surfaces and textiles.  The supplier thoughtfully included a dark blue microscoop instead of the usual white type.

Direct oral consumption of this compound is not recommended, as it causes an unpleasant tingling sensation for several minutes after contact with oral mucosa even after extensively flushing with water.  Best either placed in capsules, or if lacking them, consumed directly on top of a water layer immediately followed by consuming more water.

According to the literature, oral-RoA GTS-21 concentrations peak around 1 hour post administration.  The apparent duration of significant levels of exposure appears to be around 3-5 hours.  Human dose equivalent looks like around 75-150mg from my estimates, and it is believed safe in doses of at least 450mg/day divided into 3 equal doses.  See e.g. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12629535](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12629535) / [https://www.nature.com/articles/1300028](https://www.nature.com/articles/1300028)

I first tried 75mg.  After about 30-45 minutes I noticed some mild to moderate intensification of visually perceived color saturation and lighting dynamic range, as I often do for anything even remotely cholinergic.  The effects were similar to, albeit weaker than, e.g. coluracetam or noopept (neither of which I experiment with anymore, but that is an entirely different discussion), or for that matter nicotine itself.

I noticed a small positive effect on vigilance and concentration -- fairly subtle, though.  There was little or no sense of the task-dependent 'locking' or difficulty with context-switching that often become apparent for sufficiently high doses of stronger and more dopaminergic stimulants.  There was little or no sense of anxiety, tremors, or tachycardia, suggesting that indirect adrenergic involvement is probably fairly limited as well.  I noticed no effect whatsoever on mood, impulsivity, empathy, etc.  There was no impairment of ability to take a nap (however, I have ADHD and I can sleep through almost anything including typical therapeutic doses of amphetamines and modafinil, so ymmv).  I hardly noticed as the effects faded away, either.  There was no change in mood and no subjective desire to re-dose.

Using 150mg produced a sublinearly increased response-- the effects on vigilance and attention were marginally stronger than they had been at 75mg, but the improvement was slight at best.  The enhancement of visual color saturation and dynamic range were noticeably increased, though I do not think it was quite proportional, and it is difficult to accurately describe much beyond that given the subtleties of these phenomena.

Using 150mg followed by another 75mg at T+2 hours slightly extended the effects but did not increase their magnitude.

Unlike nicotine, racetams, or high-dose sublingual choline supplements, I did not notice any significant decrease in verbal fluency or well-ordered concentration in the aftermath of the effects wearing off.  (Cholinergics normally give me a significant rebound effect after several hours, which for sufficiently high doses can make me feel practically incapable of working or maintaining normal conversations for another several hours thereafter, so after various largely unsuccessful experiments in avoiding this outcome I do not use them at all.  This is in stark contrast with dopaminergic or adrenergic stimulants, which do not remotely do that for me.  The effect is disturbing and makes me doubt the safety of strong cholinergics in long-term use.)  Unlike dopaminergic stimulants, I did not notice any rebound fatigue or negative effects on mood or motivation.  Unlike adrenergic stimulants, I did not notice any rebound effects on sleepiness, alertness, or sharpness.

At no point did I ever experience anything that might remotely be identifiable as a nicotine-like 'craving' or subjective desire to re-administer the compound.  This is somewhat interesting, since nicotine itself always gives me a noticeable if minor desire to re-dose even after one use of 0.5-1mg sublingually-- a feeling that can linger to some extent for as long as 1-3 days.  So GTS-21 seems non-habit-forming in the short term, at least.

I do not know anything about any potential risk of long-term tolerance or dependence associated with this compound.

There were no apparent side effects whatsoever, except unpleasant oral sensations if any of the powder contacted the oral mucosa.  A bit like the sensations common for e.g. powdered propranolol or PPAP, among others.

Overall rating:

\- Effectiveness: 2/5 - noticeable but minor even up to the maximum human-tested dose

\- Rebound: 5/5 - none apparent

\- Abuse-liability: 5/5 - none apparent, at least in the short term at normal doses

\- Side effects: 5/5 - just put it in capsules instead of trying to eat powder

\- Cost: 1/5 - this is Starbucks-tier expensive - around $4.25/dose, only lasts 3-5 hours, and the latte would get a 3/5 effectiveness score from me personally

Overall, GTS-21 seems fairly innocuous, but also fairly weak.  Personally, in hindsight, I would not have ordered it, but I hope that someone finds this useful.  There do not appear to be any smaller samples readily available.  Maybe I should try to sell the rest of it or something, but this doesn't seem like the right venue given board rules.

People who really like cholinergics and/or nicotine, however, might want to give this a try.  I can at least say that it seems to have far less of a rebound than either of those two for me, with an apparently far lower risk of addiction than nicotine proper, and as far as I know I suspect it may not have the same risk of longer-term dependence common for racetams in particular (though I cannot be certain).

"Just wanted to post here and see if anyone else has experienced something similar. I’ve found a few posts of a similar nature but others finding it actually reduced social anxiety to some degree.

I’ve had one episode a few weeks back and couldn’t exactly pin point what happened I started to feel like I was almost having a heart attack or something very wrong so naturally I went to the doctor they checked my heart and told me everything was fine except slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure seemingly from the anxiety.  I had to take a small piece of anxiety medicine to eventually calm down I was feeling horrible all day.

 Now I decided to try it again and went to work and seemingly everything was great a little extra energy and focus. I know the half life isn’t particularly long but after taking it in the morning after 3 days similar problems began to erose I took the anxiety medicine a bit earlier this time and was able to get back to almost 100% normal. 

Has anyone else experienced similar problems? I would like a racetam to take without such effects I had read oxi directly increase acetylcholine production and this may be the cause of the effects vs something like Piracetam that uses more choline and doesn’t help produce more? Is this accurate? The only other nootropic I’m taking is bacopi synapsa but that I have been taken for an extended period and never noticed any problems because I would switch during the week between Oxiracetam, phenylpiracetam, and Piracetam. 

I had gotten to a point where I wanted to try Oxiracetam for a good amount of time without switching and then bad bad anxiety/panic attack came.

Any thoughts or info to help me out?

" About 25 days ago I took some doses of agmatine sulfate for 3 days and until today I still wake up under its effects. Unfortunately I had a bad reaction, I caused lethargy, anhedonia, mental fog, mental slowness, fatigue, loss of memory in the short and long term .. Simply the effects feel horrible, the worst I have tried without a doubt for me. In fact I feel that all the work I had been doing with my health and my brain was spoiled by agmatine. I understand that agmatine is stored in the body and brain and is released with neuronal activation. Every morning I wake up with these effects, similar to those I experienced when I first consumed it and it seemed to diminish at nightfall, where I do not notice that my perception and my system return to the baseline before consuming agmatine, but the effects return to appear during the morning and the rest the day .. I am exhausted to resist it since the lethargy becomes unbearable and the days are pure garbage except for moments in the moments that the effects seem to vanish. I had read by the community that after activating this system you can remain active for a month or more. This is true? Is there any way to reverse the effects of agmatine or regulate the agmatinergic system as it was before touching it? Or do I just have to wait and endure this torture?

"I started taking Magnesium as a supplement because it supposedly helps with depression and migraines. First I tried taking 500mg Magnesium Taurate in the morning and it actually worsened tensions in the neck and gave me a weird anxiety-like feeling and I did not try it again for a while. Then I read on here it helps many people sleep better and eases RLS when taken in the evening. I immediately wanted to try it. 

Two days ago I took 1.25g of Magnesium-Taurate before going to bed (10pm) and it actually helped a bit with my RLS. Even though I woke up two times and had crazy dreams the next morning I was full of energy and felt better than usual, even went jogging that morning. However, about 16 hours later (2pm) I had a crash of some sort. Body heat especially in stomach area, my head was hot. I felt dizzy and my neck was tense. My head felt like there was pressure in my brain and the sides of my head started to hurt so bad I could barely stand up. After vomiting I searched in my whole flat for sumatriptan or 250mg ASS/200mg paracetamol/50mg coffeine and luckily I found one of the latter pills. After an hour my head was lightly buzzing but no pain.

I thought maybe it was unrelated because I have these migraine attacks once or twice a month so I took 1g of Magnesium Taurate before going to bad (1am) and surely enough about 5pm today it hit me again. This was a surprise to me because I never had two of those days in a row. 

Does anyone have an idea on what could have happened? Possibly related to the Mg/Ca system?

"Hello guys!

Why do I feel weird after taking anything with caffeine?  Sometimes my whole body feels weak  and gets SICK instead of an energetic feeling. 
 
My muscles get weak, I feel dizzy and emotionally numb, like I have then less feelings (maybe apathy or so?).  Sometimes I feel irritable whereas before I felt contented and happy.   
  I often woke up pretty good and then drank coffee / or tea, and then my MOOD DROPPED IMMEDIATELY, and felt like I have real depression and getting sick. 

It's like caffeine reduces my serotonin and dopamine, but how?  
  On some days I feel pretty good after drinking caffeine but if I drink it often, the effect gets pretty bad, (like tolerance to the good effect but not to the negative side effects).


Now I need to study a lot for my exam and so I rely on my yerba mate tea and my ""focus"" supplement (with l-tyrosine, acetyl-l-carnitin and caffeine 50mg),  and maca.  
I already have cut out ""normal"" coffee and instead drink yerba mate and it might be a bit better, but I still feel like I get some of the bad ""intoxicating""-caffeine feelings. 

   So I still rely on caffeine but I know that my mood suffers from it. 


I know that I might have an imbalance in my brain /body, but I don't know what exactly it is. 
The imbalance is triggered by caffeine, and weed.

&#x200B;

I recently completed my nmr tests of nootropics and Sarm, which I ordered from China. After these results, I will make the main order (about $ 5000) from these suppliers soon and make more tests. I usually make joint purchases of different products from China for my friends and clients.

&#x200B;

I found about 12 suppliers at the beginning of the local Chinese resource. Not an alibaba, I do not like the alibaba, there are always higher prices. I asked them for the following documents for each product:

HPLC

HNMR

ICP-MS for 4 heavy metals As, Cd, Hg, Pb

COA

&#x200B;

Only 5 suppliers were able to provide up-to-date documents with tests of their products. Next, I chose those who offered more interesting prices and ordered samples.

&#x200B;

A week later I received the samples (Bromantane, NSI 189, phenibut, Noopept, Phenylpiracetam, MK677 and LGD4033) and we started the research.

"I'm not sure where else to post this, but I thought y'all might get a kick out of it. I'm taking a Neuro lab that is literally just a semester-long experiment where we get to (as a class) choose a compound or procedure to mess with the circadian rhythms of big ol cockroaches and then measure Per1 (and maybe BMAL) expression. Having experimented with SR9009 myself (I do not condone this) I thought it might be a fun experiment, considering SR9009 works directly upstream of these genes and consistently raises Per1 expression in rats following administration. My class was super down for it, so my TA picked up 25mg of SR9009 from Sigma and we've just labeled and grouped the cockroaches.

&#x200B;

There are four groups of five cockroaches. One is control (vehicle injection--sesame oil most likely), group two will receive 1mg/kg, three at 10mg/kg, and four (my group!) at 100mg/kg since we have no idea how the bioavailability will differ between I.P. injections in rats (100mg/kg in most studies) and whatever this injection classifies as in cockroaches.

&#x200B;

I'll be able to answer questions as the lab proceeds but the cockroaches will be getting their first injections over the weekend. My TA seems to have this experiment very well planned out in her head but I think she's a little too excited about it and keeps forgetting to tell us specific details (she was stoked from day one when I mentioned this compound since she's in a research group that studies REV-ERB and ROR genes).

"Just like Magnesium deficiency takes time to manifest if you're eating poorly, it takes time to reverse it once you have it.

[A human study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29425476) found that 3 months of daily Magnesium supplementation are needed to significantly increase RBC (Red Blood Cell) Magnesium levels. The study used Magnesium Di-Malate (supplement form is usually Magnesium Mono-Malate, should be similar), and Vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as it is known B6 improves Magnesium absorption.

After 30 days, the participants had a 6% higher RBC Mg content. After 90 days, however, the participants had a 30% higher RBC Mg content, which is considered a significant increase. The 6% increase at 30 days could be beneficial as well, but it shows that restoring normal Magnesium stores in the body can take a long time.

Magnesium Malate is known to be well absorbed, but even with its good absorption, it can take as long as 3 months to fix a deficiency. 

****

It seems like many people here decide that a certain Magnesium supplement is useless, after only a few weeks on it, and then switch to another one that they claim to find more effective.

&#x200B;

So L-Theanine is a glutamate analog (similar structure) and thus it acts also as an antagonist (by blocking the receptors?). In many cases this would help decrease anxiety by allowing less glutamate to bind to the receptors, but in cases of people who have trouble converting glutamate to GABA, L-Theanine would actually increase anxiety because it effectively increases the glutamate concentration due to its analogous nature?

&#x200B;

And so potential solutions to this would be to either lower the dose of L-Theanine, or to supplement it with something that would decrease glutamate levels such as NAC?

"Basically I’ve looked into 5-HTP extensively and ultimately discovered it must be taken with EGCg to make sure most of it actually goes to the CNS. And to also supplement L-Tyrosine, to balance serotonin and dopamine. (At a 1:10 ratio). I’m using for ADD.

And it works amazingly. Like really well. I have taken 100-200mg 5-HTP with 1000-2000mg L-Tyrosine along side EGCg. 

But after a few weeks of doing this, a serious thought set in. If it works so well, is there withdrawal? As I’ve never seen anyone talk about if they’ve had withdrawals haven taken them correctly. And if I did have withdrawals I didn’t want to depend on these supplements.

I decided to test it. For 3-4 days after stopping use. Very clear withdrawals. Mostly just anxiety, and mild. But definitely noticeable as I normally don’t get much anxiety, and none with this stack. 

I really would like to continue, as my body metabolizes ADD meds way too fast, and the cons outweigh the pros. As I don’t get withdrawal from my ADD meds, but this stack I do. I have since not taken this stack in fear of perhaps what if I had tried stopping way later, would the withdrawals have gotten worse?

I guess this is just a report that withdrawals of these taken correctly, do exist. And maybe if anyone had similar experience / ideas on how I could continue.

"Hi guys. A while back I experienced a rather, uh, interesting effect, that I can't help thinking about sometime. So I'm here. 
I saw a similar post long ago and somebody mentioned something like ""Sounds like a vagus nerve dysfunction"", but unfortunately that's all I remember. 

So imagine that I'm in pain (muscle tension, light burning, random stinging, etc.) especially in my head/face, shoulders, neck, and arms) pretty much 24/7. It's a very harsh combo with the otherwise lethargic weakness that also happens to my body. My hands shake constantly, I feel dizzy, my chest hurts and is very tight, it's always a strain to breathe and...yeah. Stuff sucks. 

People always say that I look like I'm dying. I am not making this up.  I am a 24 year old 5""6 149 girl--I'm healthy chubby. I used to be obese, but losing weight, eating healthy (literally used to only eat junk food because kid me was left home alone 24/7), and getting more active 100% did not help me feel any better. It was one of the biggest let-downs in my life.
I do basic things and people constantly ask if I'm okay or need a paramedic, or that over the phone someone says ""Wait, you sound like you have to go to the emergency room, you're short of breath..."" 

Technically I've already saw the doctor a few times. I found out I had asthma this year (250-300 spirometry score 24/7, never got higher even after starting inhaler use) that is actually always on, a vitamin D and zinc deficiency. Unfortunately medicating these didn't provide any effect. But, my asthma was ""Mild"" to the doc, so I suppose it's not a big deal. 

It was a piracetam that seemed to cause a change...I'm 60% sure it was the ani one. I believe I took it besides NAC and some fish oil. It was 4PM I took it. 

Of course there's another aspect here; how little I ate that day, had a bowl (sweet potato hash, egg, biscuit) around 10AM. Eating sparsely is pretty rare for me. And, I did take a walk instead of taking the shuttle to the school cafe earlier--for some reason taking the shuttle or a car, even for a few minutes, has made me feel pretty bad for a few hours. I also took some Benadyrl, which for some reason does make me feel less like a zombie 50% of the time--the effect is very notable, and nothing else works--not even caffeine. 

So...a lot of these criteria I met before with little to no improvement (in fact, taking walks or any physical activity makes me feel more suffocated and my body far more painful/tight almost 100% of the time--it just wasn't as bad as taking a ride instead).

But this time? 

I felt bright-eyed...my eyes weren't sunken for the first time in...15 years? Literally captured proof of it. I could breathe easy. I felt relaxed, it wasn't just extremely uncomfortable sitting down. Loose, except...the lethargic feeling was 100% gone, I felt really in tune with my body. It wasn't even that I was feeling pleasure or high, I was just...energetic yet relaxed.  All my symptoms were gone. I even was talking and joking around with people, guys.. I usually am so out of it or slurring my words. 

I remember gradually just feeling better. Yeah! I went out to class 6PM, and I felt very good then despite everything. Afterwards, I felt even better. The effect lasted till I slept and...in the morning I again felt awful. 

So there's that. I wanted to get feedback on whether or not this meant anything--and where I should proceed from here. I already got tested for some things at the doc and I don't think it's a medical condition causing this...there's just, something off about my body that I think is fixable. I'm just not sure how to proceed from here or what to try.

"Hi all - I'm a medical student and one of the banes of medical student life is afternoon clinics.

&#x200B;

You sit there doing nothing from 1PM - 5PM. The doctor is friendly and does his/her best to teach you things, but most of the time the patients are running late so you sit there while the doctor does admin work in between patients. And when the patient/s are in, you have to sit there like a perfect statue. The afternoon slump then hits you, and you fight to not fall asleep right there and then in front of the patient. I will admit - I got caught once and it was embarrassing :(

&#x200B;

What did I think of yesterday to solve this problem? NODOZ :D

&#x200B;

So it was 1:40PM. Clinic was about to start, and I was quite drowsy because I couldn't get to sleep the previous night.

&#x200B;

2:00...has the drug hit me yet?...I'm struggling to keep my eyes open...I was lucky to catch my drool before it hits my pants

&#x200B;

2:15...I FEEL IT...I felt that kick...my heart is racing...my body is alert...I'm so alive!

I take my pulse rate...it's 70...is that high?...for me I think it is

&#x200B;

3:15...oh my god this thing is magic...I'm still hyperalert...I close my eyes for 5s to see if I feel like napping...nop I can't sleep even if I tried to...it's so easy to pay attention to everything now...when I went through years of struggling through afternoon clinic

&#x200B;

5:00...Clinic is finished. I still feel hyperalert. I walk around the hospital. I see a few familiar faces and they are all tired from the whole day, slumped down on seats and couches (in the common room). I am still hyperalert as fuck...I actually feel like Neo in The Matrix where I can see everythinggggg in slowed-down real time.

&#x200B;

I was reading the beginner post on r/Nootropics during clinic and I saw something interesting: ""take melatonin 30 minutes before sleeping time to fix your sleep."" I have always had problems with insomnia and I have just pushed past, thinking it was just part of life.

&#x200B;

So I chat up some friends on Facebook on melatonin. A friend has some so I drive over to his gym where he is working out, and he gives me 10 to try out.

&#x200B;

I take it at 10:45pm after a shower...I turn off the lights at 11:15pm...

&#x200B;

It was such a weird feeling. My friends have told me that I have a powerful mind, and I'm used to my brain racing while I'm lying in bed at night, thinking up 10 new ideas and or thinking about someone I have come across.

&#x200B;

But this time this heavy brain fog descended on my mind. It shut my mind down. It didn't let my mind think a million thoughts an hour when it normally does. It felt really strange and I was a bit scared at first. But I remember what my friend told me previously - ""Just let it take over.""

&#x200B;

So I surrendered to the feeling. So weird for me not being able to think 10,000 ideas at night haha.

A few years back my doctor let me know that my Vitamin D3 levels were low and that my blood glucose levels were high. He switched me over to a keto diet and that solved my glucose levels. I also picked up some vitamin D3 when I switched over to keto.

My experience with vitamin D3 is difficult to describe because at the time I felt more emotional in the days after starting taking D3. I kept wit my diet and tried to push through the feeling thinking that maybe the emotions were coming from withdraws from not having all the carbs converting to glucose in my system.

That was also during a much happier time in my life, where things were changing quickly and a lot was going on. So truth be told, I would never have been able to determine rhodiola's true effect on my mood, energy levels, and mental health in general.

Fast forward to last week: I decided to try out rhodiola again, as I've started to get worn down from working long hours at 2 different jobs. What I've noticed since I've started talking rhodiola can be 100% attributed to the rhodiola itself; no other drug/supplement use has changed, no life circumstances have changed. Everything is exactly the same for me as it was 2 weeks ago, except for the addition of rhodiola (250 mg of 3% rosavin extract, twice daily).

Suddenly, I'm able to be positive with little to no effort. I wake up in the morning happy, not grumpy. Tasks that once ruined my entire mood aren't *fun,* but they don't drag me down anymore either. I don't look forward to running out of it (because I know I should cycle it, to avoid wearing the benefits completely out), but I'm glad to know there seems to be something that can get me through my days without addiction, withdrawal, or any discernible side effects at all.

Has anyone else in the sub noticed such a drastic change due to rhodiola?",79,1536537153.0,Nootropics,9edyvn,102,Rhodiola seems to be changing my entire mindset,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9edyvn/rhodiola_seems_to_be_changing_my_entire_mindset/

"# Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, i am not a biochemistry expert, i am simply a consumer that has personally used these drugs and has also researched them at the basic level through online studies, anecdotal reports, and wikipedia/psychonaut/NCBI, also keep in mind any side effects i report does not mean you will for sure have that issue, and just because i may say i do not have a commonly reported side effect for a certain drug also does not mean you won't too.

# 

# Even though i may recommend these drugs, please do not immediately go out and purchase them after reading this post, i encourage the reader to do his/her own research from multiple sources before making the decision, i also do not recommend benzo's/phenibut if you have a very addictive nature towards drugs.

&#x200B;

# Since this thread is going well i have decided to make this a top 4 list, i feel like ashwaghanda is too important to leave out on second thought.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Valium - By far the hardest hitter for me, this could possibly be second to xanax but i haven't taken xanax before so i don't know, side effects are extreme sleepiness and mild slurring along with decreased REM activity (less quality sleep), overall though it is a very good drug to have incase you are having a very very bad anxiety episode, **i want to emphasize that this drug is extremely addictive and you must use it only when you absolutely have to, this drug is terrible for using on routine but great for using occasionally every once in a blue moon**

&#x200B;

Addiction potential (Physical - 9/10) - Recommended to only use every 10 or so days

Intoxication potential (5/10)

Onset: 20-25 minutes (10/10) - Kicks in extremely, extremely fast, in my experience it is half that of l-theanine's onset time, good for panic episodes

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Phenibut - This is my favorite drug, even though it is not the most potent on this list there are benefits that make up for it, it has a very long duration, it seems to intoxicate you much less than a benzodiazapine, it is currently legal to purchase in america without a prescription, i usually use this drug on nights where i am extremely sleep deprived so i get very good quality sleep, and i had woken up extremely refreshed every time, it also does not fail to kill any nightly anxiety for me, **although physical addiction with this drug is a very real thing and i only advise to use it in occasion much like valium**.

&#x200B;

Addiction potential (Physical - 8/10) - Recommended to only use every 7-9 days

Intoxication potential (4/10)

Onset : 1-2 hours (2/10) - Bad while having panic attacks, good for GAD and preventing panics once it actually kicks in

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. L-Theanine - Possibly the most potent drug for its extremely low abuse and addiction potential, this is one anti-anxiety drug i would consider to be fool proof, the onset is within around 40 minutes for me and seems to last around six hours, most of the time this drug does not fail me at 200mg, and if it does i'll take 400mg, there currently has been no recorded direct deaths from overdose or withdrawal (which doesn't exist at least to a noticable extent) from this drug, Side effects for me is maybe brain fog however that is about it.

&#x200B;

Addiction potential (1/10) - Can mostly be used daily without issue, although tolerance is reported and in rare cases rebound anxiety is also reported after long term daily dosing, even then it is said to be pretty mild.

Intoxication potential (0/10)

Onset:  Around 40 minutes  (6/10) - Kind of delayed compared to most benzos, but not at snail speed like phenibut

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Ashwaghanda - Many people report ashwaghanda is more potent than l-theanine in terms of anti anxiety, however for me i find its potency and effectiveness lower, this does not mean that it doesn't do a pretty decent job still, this drug works mostly on cortisol levels rather than gaba agonism, so it is very unique in the way that it mitigates anxiety, there is a downside though as it has been highly reported that long-term use may result in thyroid problems, however i have just been taking this occasionally and have seen absolutely zero issues besides the weaker potency comparatively to l-theanine, this often fails to kill any panic attacks i am having, but it is definitely a noticable and significant drop in anxiety when i am having waves of general anxiety.

&#x200B;

Addiction potential (0/10) - I've read no reports of this causing any sort of physical addiction and there is very little evidence showing that it is addictive,i have taken this daily for 3 weeks once and had absolutely zero issues when stopping daily use, but i encourage anyone who has seen problems with withdrawals to please post about your anecdote as that would be useful.

Intoxication potential (0/10) - I have not felt any sort of difference in my cognition even in 1 gram doses, if anything i feel as if my cognition is slightly improved actually

Onset: Around an hour (5/10) - More delayed than l-theanine but not by much honestly.

"For a few years now I’ve had a persistent case of brain fog. It gets worse when I sleep fully, I.e 8 hours. If I’m feeling sleep deprived, the fog itself is somewhat abated but I have all the cognitive deficiencies that come with less sleep.

My brain fog is a muddling of poor short term memory, slow reaction time, a very powerful unwillingness to engage in any kit of cognitively demanding task, and just the urge to do nothing and go back to sleep. 

Caffeine, nicotine, semax, phenylpiracetam, piracetam, theanine, prl-8-53, testosterone replacement therapy, exercise, magnesium, probiotics, sleeping with no light/sound, and a bunch of other things have not helped it at all.

I started taking creatine on a whim after hearing it might help with maintaining proper cognition after sleep deprivation. Unexpectedly, I have felt a very significant reduction in my brain fog. I can feel it cutting through the fog, I am able to think more holistically instead of barely being able to focus on one small thing at a time. My memory has returned. And so has my motivation. 

This is a dose of 3.5 grams daily for the last 15 days. I have seen no build up of tolerance.

I am submitting this to provide another data point as well as to see if anyone has had any similar experiences. I will update if I stop taking creatine or if the effects change.

EDIT1: The brand is a GNC brand. Monohydrate. Nothing special.

EDIT2: I mention tolerance because if creatine is working in a novel way to treat my brain fog, that way might accrue tolerance. It does act on adenosine and NMDA receptors and therefore might be possible. This isn’t about how you took creatine for years in the gym and it worked great for that extra pump, every time.

"Hi

I have always had a bad memory as far as I can remember. Studying at school but really struggling at exams because of this. Later on during my uni days and early years in my first job, I learnt a lot about mnemonics. I practised a lot (for anyone who's interested free courses & lots of useful information available on [https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/) &  https://artofmemory.com). I also learnt in depth about how our memory works and realised it was mostly my recall stage that sucked. I just couldn't remember things when i needed to, i would however recall them an hour later or a day later in some cases. 

Now few years ago I was really into biohacking and tdcs kinda stuff. I noticed that my memory was suddenly getting better. First time I realised it was because of the names recall of new people I had met and movie titles. It was very noticeable. Using the elimination method, I narrowed it down to Ginseng and Gingko but mainly it came down to Ginseng. Before you ask me which ginseng, I have no idea since I just picked up a ginseng 'complex'. I will paste the details below for anyone interested. Anyone despite loving my newly found better 'memory', I couldn't carry on with ginseng because it upset my tummy. 

Fast forward few months ago, I started ginseng again for and the memory effect is even more pronounced! It took almost 2 weeks to work it but then it's so noticeable for someone like myself who has always struggled to remember movie titles for example when mentioning it to friends. *So first I am interested if someone can explain to me what type(Kor/Chi/Sib) of ginseng is causing this recall improvement and why?*

&#x200B;

**2nd Part:** Ginseng and even to a greater extent Gingko causes an annoying issue for me. I have always suffered from cold feet. Temperature drops barely below 20C and my feet are freezing cold, hands a little bit but neck and face very warm & sweaty underarms! From what I understand this is mild form of reynauds. Now Ginseng unfortunately makes it worse. I would love to carry on using it but here in the midst of our British 'summer', I am wearing heated socks! Gingko is even worse. Now my theory for memory improvement was that just like exercise Ginseng must be increasing the blood flow to organs hence perhaps memory improvement (over-simplification!) but unlike exercise which makes your entire body feel warm, *what possibly could ginseng be doing to make parts of my body even colder and other warmer? Also if anyone knows of any supplements that could help with cold extremities, please share* and make my miserable life a little less miserable :P

"Like quite a few people, anything that remotely affects choline sends me into an unnatural, hyper-agitated depression. Even the slight amount of choline/inositol in vitamin gummy will make me feel like shit. Piracetam plus a small fish oil capsule will bring me to the lowest depression possible. It's not fun.

\- Piracetam 400mg solo = same unnatural, hyper-agitated depression.

\- Poking a knife into a Piracetam capsule and dabbing a minuscule 20mg worth on my tongue = same unnatural, semi-agitated depression.

Surprisingly, the only thing that worked was eating two bacon & egg tacos and downing 400mg of Piracetam with my morning cup of coffee. Boom, suddenly all those coveted effects came true. Incredible stuff. Worked like a charm the whole year.

"So I have Schizoaffective disorder and have been researching things to help some of the symptoms, including cognitive.  I am taking a look at D-Serine and see that google declares up top when searching 'd-serine half life' that  ""Although the plasma half-life in mice was not reported, the terminal elimination half-life in the brain was determined to be **1 h**, which likely indicates a similarly short half-life of CBIO in plasma. This explains the inability of CBIO to maintain high levels of d-serine plasma levels for a sustained period of time. ""  A search for 'Sarcosine half life' has the same amount of time.

To those that use either, do you feel that this equates to a short duration of effects?  More precisely to what I'm trying to find out, about how long is the duration of action of both of these separate substances, d-serine and sarcosine?  I unfortunately do not have the scientific education to know myself how to fully interpret these search results (for instance, don't know what the above mentioned CBIO is) so please forgive my lack of knowledge.

Another related question I have, does anyone know how many half-lives are expended typically before a substance is no longer detectable to the user?  I imagine that it would vary with things like dosage taken and other things that I am unaware of, but is there a somewhat reliable middle ground of the curve?

Thank you, and I look forward to soaking up the knowledge around here :)

"Hello all, 

Since my brain fog is nearly eradicated with anti-inflammatories, I have turned my attention to what i consider to be a safer alternative to conventional Aspirin treatment, or, for that matter, any traditional, normal-dose NSAID therapy.  This includes but is not limited to: Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Naproxen, Celecoxib, etc.

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the activity of COX-2 without inhibiting it directly, causing it to produce anti-inflammaotry molecules.  Aspirin and other NSAIDS, for this reason, are not recommended for long-term use.  Typical Aspirin pills contain 325mg Aspirin.

Both Fish Oil and Aspirin have seen their ups and downs as heart disease fighters.  However, Fish Oil does have considerable evidence for possesing anti-inflammatory mechanisms. DHA supplementation has been shown to [lower inflammatory markers] (https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/139/3/495/4670362) in some conditions. Aspirin has a large body of evidence concerning its efficacy as an anti-inflammatory, with even ultra-low doses (81mg every third day), (40mg every third day), which achieved [surprisingly significant effects] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11190906), considering how low of a dose was employed.


We know that Aspirin and Fish Oil together produced [more potent anti-inflammatory effects versus Aspirin alone.] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3683095/)  So, here lies the heart of the matter.  Aspirin has a somewhat special ability to activate Fish Oil.  Since Fish Oil is generally one of the safest anti-inflammatories to take, Aspirins ability to activate and amplify its effects could mean large doses of Aspirin or other NSAIDS may not be needed.  Fish Oil can metabolize into a family of potent anti-inflammatories known as Resolvins.  They are employed in the body during the later stages of an inflammatory response in order to “resolve” the inflammation. Researchers have spoken of the [large degree of potency and efficacy] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3849791/) they can produce.  Aspirin amplifies this process of metabolism effectively increasing the potency of Omega-3 to reduce inflammation.


We know that Aspirin can still carry out its mechanisms while used at an Ultra-Low dose.  (40mg every THIRD day, over three days this is literally **4%** of typical once-a-day Aspirin, and only **17%** of daily Baby Aspirin therapy, which is widely considered a safe regimen by doctors.)  The dose could be tinkered with to fall into this range, with 81mg/day being the upper limit.

My hypothesis is that the anti-inflammatory effects of Aspirin can be reproduced with the addition of DHA-rich Omega 3, while using ultra-low doses of Aspirin.  This may effectively mitigate or even eradicate the bleeding/gastrointestinal risks Aspirin carries.  In my opinion, half a baby Aspirin (40.5mg) daily in conjunction with either 1 or 2 NOW-Foods DHA-500 capsules could be a legitimate, potent anti-inflammatory strategy.",70,1536287519.0,Nootropics,9dljxc,150,Ultra Low-Dose Aspirin + DHA-rich Fish Oil is certainly a safer and possibly a more potent anti-inflammatory combination than Aspirin alone.

"Resveratrol is a polyphenol known for its multiple health benefits, including increased mitochondrial function^[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5622777/) , longevity^[[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443915000216) , and exercise capacity^[[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3424731/) . However, its poor oral bioavailability hinders its use in humans.

In a [study](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\(12\)00030-X) published in the scientific journal Cell in 2012, it was found that Resveratrol is a non-selective Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme inhibitor, and thus increases cAMP & cGMP levels.  It was then discovered that increasing cAMP levels reproduces all of the benefits of Resveratrol, which led to the conclusion that Resveratrol improves health by inhibiting cAMP-PDEs, and increasing cAMP levels.

As expected, Rolipram, a selective cAMP-PDE (PDE4) inhibitor, has been found to reproduce all of the metabolic benefits of Resveratrol, to very similar magnitudes.

While Rolipram was in trials and is now discontinued, and is thus unavailable, Ibudilast is another PDE4 inhibitor that is still being prescribed in certain Asian countries.

Both Microglia and macrophages, in the case of a desseminated CNS infections such as neuroborreliosis, spirochetosis, neuro-syphilis and other neurodegenerative diseases, though not infectious based and thought to be autoimmune disorders in my view will be considered autoimmune with the root etiology being a lose of blood brain barrier cohesion/integrity and the reactivation of latent infectious agents that pass through the BBB. This very well could be a negative feedback loop, as Quinolinic Acid is a potent nmda agonist (cell death) which unfortunately can break down the BBB. QUIN is secreted from the immune system for the purpose of fighting infections. Keep in mind QUIN is needed to produce NAD+ but not at the excessive levels in the brain we see with many neurological infections. Borrelia infection which is extremely common, if not treated can cause MS, ALS, and Alzheimer's like ""symptoms"" among many others, very much like neuro-syphilis, both Borrelia and syphilis are close cousins.

There is a general consensus that Lyme disease symptoms, whether acute or chronic, are driven largely by inflammation, this could be because of the persistence of the spirochetal forms, dormant cystic forms and their DNA graduals with CNS resivours or an autoimmune reaction caused by post-erradication. In late-stage Lyme disease, the inflammatory cytokines of the early (innate) immune response – particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) – are chronically activated, causing direct damage both within and outside the central nervous system (Habicht 1992; Ramesh et al. 2005; Kisand et al. 2007; Ramesh et al. 2008; Rupprecht et al. 2008).  A high percentage of patients in the advanced stages of disease suffer from inflammation of white matter and cerebral hypoperfusion (Fallon & Nields 1994; Fallon et al. 1995; Sumiya et al. 1997; Fallon et al. 1997; Logigian et al. 1997; Plutchok et al. 1999; Heinrich et al. 2003; Fallon et al. 2003; Donta et al. 2006; Fallon et al. 2009). Besides direct damage, chronic inflammation also triggers excessive and imbalanced catabolism of tryptophan, causing tryptophan depletion, neurotoxicity, and a form of immunosuppression -- also found several forms of cancer and HIV infection -- that significantly impairs the effector T cell response required to attack both intracellular and extracellular infection.
____
Low-dose, IV ketamine is a promising option for rapid, highly-effective symptom relief, damage reduction, and prevention of T cell suppression in late-stage Lyme disease. Even in low doses, ketamine is a potent anti-inflammatory, inhibiting TNF-alpha and IL-6 (Royblat et al. 1998; Shapira et al. 2004; Bartoc et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2006; Beilin et al. 2007). Ketamine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (Pai & Heining 2007), and has been shown using brain SPECT scans in human studies to improve cerebral blood flow in patients suffering from cerebral hypoperfusion (Wu et al. 2006; Guedj et al. 2007a; Guedj et al. 2007b).

Phase II clinical trials, small studies, and individual case reports have shown low-dose IV ketamine to be remarkably effective in reducing symptoms of several conditions that appear in late-stage Lyme disease, including refractory depression (Berman et al. 2000; Kudoh et al. 2002; Zarate et al. 2006; Correll & Futter 2006; Liebrenz et al. 2007a; Liebrenz et al. 2007b; Goforth & Holsinger 2007; Paulet al. 2008; Stefanczyk-Sapieha et al. 2008; Matthew et al. 2009), fibromyalgia (Sörensen et al. 1995; Sörensen et al. 1997; Graven-Nielsen et al. 2000; Guedj et al. 2007a; Guedj et al. 2007b), and chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) (Harbut & Correll 2002; Correll et al. 2004; Goldberg et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2006; Kiefer et al. 2007; Villanueva-Perez et al. 2007; Jeffreys & Woods 2007; Koffler et al. 2007; Shirani et al. 2008)– although the most advanced cases of refractory CRPS may require anesthetic dosing (Kiefer et al. 2008a; Kiefer et al. 2008b; Becerra et al. 2009).    

Case reports have also shown ketamine to be effective inother syndromes that appear in Lyme disease, including status epilepticus, explosive disorder, MS-like syndrome, Parkinsonism, and stroke. 

In 2007, Charney et al. reported remarkable and sustained benefits in three highly-refractory depressed patients after four or five ketamine infusions over successive days, with benefits lasting up to 28 days. Kollmar et al. reported in 2008 that a refractory, psychiatric in-patient with ten recent suicide attempts, no response to pharmacological agents, and only partial response to ECT, obtained symptom relief for three days after one low-dose ketamine infusion. Two weeks after the first infusion, she was given a second low-dose infusion, followed by regular dosing with oral memantine. The patient experienced remission shortly after the second infusion. She remained in remission six months later, when her case report was submitted for publication.   

**Kynurenine pathway-mediated excitotoxicity and oxidative stress**
_____
_____
Aside from causing direct inflammatory damage, inflammatory cytokines fuel neurotoxicity by activating enzymes that cause excessive or pathogenically imbalanced catabolism of CNS L-tryptophan (TRP) and its metabolites -- known as kynurenines -- via the kynurenine pathway. TRP is one of the ten essential amino acids, is involved in protein synthesis, and acts as a precursor of many biologically active substances (Robotka et al. 2008). When significantly elevated in the CNS, the tryptophan metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN) is neurotoxic (Guillemin et al. 2005; Halperin & Heyes 1992). And even moderate elevation of the tryptophan metabolite 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-OH-KYN) causes neurotoxicity (Wichers & Maes 2004; Moroni et al. 1999; Okuda et al. 1998). Cerebrospinal fluid levels of QUIN are significantly elevated in disseminated and late-stage Lyme disease -- dramatically in Lyme neuroborreliosis, and to a lesser degree in Lyme encephalopathy without intra-CNS inflammation (Halperin & Heyes 1992). Likewise, increased concentrations of neopterin and of the tryptophan degradation product, L-kynurenine, are detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with acute Lyme neuroborreliosis (Gasse et al. 1994; Fuchs et al. 1991). No studies of CNS levels 3-OH-KYN in B. burgdorferi infection have been published.  CNS inflammation and kynurenine imbalances are found in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative syndromes, including depression (Raison et al. 2010; Maes et al. 2009; Myint et al. 2007; Wichers et al. 2005; ), schizophrenia (cites), Parkinsonism (elevated 3-OH-KYN, reduced KYNA) (Mogi et al. 1994a; Mogi et al. 1994b; Blum-Degen et al. 1995; Muller et al. 1998; Mirza et al. 2000; Nagatsu et al. 2000; Hald & Lotharius 2005; Mosley et al. 2006), early-stage Huntington’s disease (elevated 3-OH-KYN and QUIN)(Heyes et al. 1992a; Guidetti & Schwarcz 2003; ), AIDS dementia (elevated QUIN) (Heyes et al. 1992a), autism and autistic spectrum disorders (elevated brain levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-y (cites). . .  

Parkinsonism typically involves CNS inflammation (Mirza et al. 2000), with increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-3, and IL-6 in CSF, and in the postmortem striatum and substantia nigra.50-56 Likewise, elevated levels of 3-OH-KYN are found in the CSF, and in the postmortem brain.59-66 Excitotoxic overactivation of the NMDA receptors in Parkinsonism is mediated in large part by low levels of kynurenic acid, a tryptophan metabolite that is the only known endogenous NMDA receptor antagonist. (Ogawa et al. 1992; Stone 2001a; Erhardt et al. 2009; Stone 1993; Stone 2001b; Sas et al 2007; Németh et al. 2006; Borlangan et al. 2000).Kynurenic acid and 3-OH-KYN are both synthesized from N-formylkynurenine (N-formyl-KYN), but involving different enzymes. 

**Tryptophan/Kynurenine Pathway**
____
____
Tryptophan is metabolized in several pathways. The most widely known is the serotonergic pathway, which is active in platelets and neurons, and yields 5-hydroxy-TRP, and then serotonin. TRP is also the precursor of the pineal hormone, melatonin. But ninety five percent of TRP within the brain is catabolized through the kynurenine pathway (Robotka et al. 2008). In this pathway, the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) catalyzes the first step in tryptophan degradation. (See figure 1).   Elevated TNF-alpha increases production of the cytokine IFN-gamma, which exerts a powerful stimulus on IDO. Excessive or pathogenically imbalanced catabolism through the kynurenine pathway results in production of neurotoxic levels of 3-OH-KYN and QUIN (Robotka et al. 2008; Vamos et al. 2009; Guillemin et al. 2003; Guillemin et al. 2001), and insufficient levels of the only known endogenous NMDA receptor antagonist, kynurenic acid (KYNA). 

**IDO Enzyme**
____
____

In the human brain, IDO is expressed in microglia (Guillemin et al. 2003; Wichers et al 2005; Vamos et al. 2009) and in part in the astrocytes (Guillemin et al. 2001; Vamos et al. 2009). Infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia are the major source of QUIN within the brain (Heyes et al. 1992b; Espey et al. 1997; Guillemin et al. 2001; Guillemin et al. 2005). Although the kynurenine pathway is fully expressed in both microglia and macrophages, for unknown reasons, macrophages have a much greater capacity of producing QUIN than microglia (Guillemin et al. 2003; Guillemin et al. 2005). Human astrocytes are not able to produce QUIN, but are capable by themselves of producing L-kynurenine, which is the substrate for 3-OH-KYN synthesis. IDO activation by infiltrating macrophages is particularly damaging because IL-4, which downregulates IDO activity, is found in low levels in the brain [verify with more research] (Wesselingh et al. 1993). The role of 3-OH-KYN in brain physiology is unknown, but in primate lenses it appears to play a role in protecting the retina from UV radiation (Vamos et al. 2009; Vasquez et al. 2002). Even relatively low levels of 3-OH-KYN may cause neurotoxicity by inducing oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis (Wichers et al. 2004; Moroni et al. 1999; Okuda et al. 1998). QUIN acts as an agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subgroup containing subunits NR2A and NR2B. Significant elevation of CNS QUIN causes a form of neurotoxicity -- known as excitotoxicity -- by over-activating NMDA receptors in the brain hippocampus. This allows excessive influx of calcium into neurons (Robotka et al. 2008; Vamos et al. 2009), inhibits glutamate uptake into the synaptic vesicle, leading to excessive microenvironment glutamate concentrations (Robotka et al. 2008; Vamos et al. 2009), and promotes lipid peroxidation (Robotka et al. 2008; Rios & Santamaria 1991; Behan & Stone 2002). Elevated QIUN might also potentiate its own neurotoxicity and that of other excitatory amino acids in the context of energy depletion (Robotkaet al. 2008; Schurr & Rigor 1993; Bordelon et al. 1997; Schuck et al. 2006). Moreover, 3-OH-KYN and QUIN appear to cause neurotoxicity in a synergistic manner: co-injection of these kynurenines into the striatum of rats causes substantial neuronal loss in doses that cause no or minimal neurodegeneration when injected alone (Robotka et al. 2008; Guidetti et al. 1991). 


QUIN-induced damage is also potentiated by reactive oxygen radicals (Behan et al. 2002; Stone & Darlington 2002). Because KYNA is an NMDA receptor antagonist, insufficient levels of this kynurenine are functionally similar to elevated levels of QUIN. Glutamate, like QUIN, is an NMDA receptor agonist. In the mammalian CNS, glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter, and is essential for normal brain functions (Ozawa et al. 1998). Glutamate accumulation into synaptic vesicles is the initial critical step for physiologic glutamatergic neurotransmission (Özkan & Ueda 1998). However, overstimulation of the glutamatergic system, which occurs when extracellular glutamate levels increase over the physiological range, is involved in many acute and chronic brain diseases due to excitotoxicity (Maragakis & Rothstein 2004). elevated extracellular QUIN stimulates synaptosomal glutamate release (Tavares et al. 2002) and inhibits glutamate uptake into astrocytes (Tavares et al. 2002). Moreover, extracellular elevation of excitotoxic QUIN results in overlapping glutamate excitotoxicity. Elevated extracellular QUIN and glutamate are found in ., including epilepsy (
Meldrum 1994), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Spreux-Varoquaux et al., 2002), probably Parkinsonism (Maragakis & Rothstein 2004), perhaps Huntington’s (Maragakis & Rothstein 2004). In order to avoid excessive increases of extracellular glutamate and glutamatergic excitotoxicity, glutamate must be taken up from synaptic cleft to the cytosol of glial and neuronal cells to be stored into synaptic vesicles on neuronal terminals (Robinson & Dowd, 1997; Anderson and Swanson, 2000; Fykse & Fonnum, 1996; Wolosker et al., 1996). The most significant mechanism for maintaining extracellular glutamate levels below neurotoxic concentrations is uptake by astrocytes. (Rothstein et al., 1996). However, elevated extracellular QUIN stimulates synaptosomal glutamate release (Tavares et al. 2002) and inhibits glutamate uptake into astrocytes (Tavares et al. 2002). Thus, excessive extracellular concentration of excitotoxic QUIN results in overlapping glutamate excitotoxicity.


**IDO/kynurenine pathway-mediated immune dysregulation**
____
_____


Suppression of CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells and/or induction of T regulatory cells 
caused by overactivation of IDO and concomitant activation of the kynurenine pathway is 
likely to be a significant immunosuppressive mechanism in advanced Lyme disease, and 
may also contribute to autoimmune reactions.

A simplified overview of some key components in the adaptive immune response helps 
in understanding the potential effects of IDO/kynurenine pathway-mediated dysregulation of the immune system.During the early (innate) immune response, macrophages and dendritic cellsphagocytize extracellular pathogens and also cells that are infected by microbial pathogens (intracellular infection). Dendritic cells are an important link between the innate and adaptive immune response. They present antigen-derived molecules from phagocytized microbes to T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs, i.e., the lymph nodes, the spleen, and the mucosal and cutaneous immune systems. For this reason, they are one of the most important types of antigen presenting cells (APCs).Dendritic cells carrying class I major histocompatibility (MHC-I) molecules from phagocytized intracellular microbes are recognized only by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Cytotoxic T cells recognize and attack only intracellular infections.  [How are CD8+ Tregs differentiated? By characteristics of dendritic cells carrying MHC-I molecules?]Dendritic cells carrying MHC-II molecules from phagocytized extracellular microbes are recognized only by CD4+ T cells. Depending, among other things, on characteristics of the dendritic cells that deliver MHC-II molecules to the peripheral lymphoid organs, CD4+ T cells differentiate into T helper 1 (Th1) cells, T helper 2 (Th2) cells, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, or T regulatory cells (Tregs).   Th1 lymphocytes produce inflammatory cytokines that assist macrophages in phagocytosis of cells harboring intracellular infection.  

IDO and kynurenine pathway activation have multiple protective functions in immune system regulation. On the one hand, induction of IDO plays an important role in the innate immune response during early stages of several infections (Njau et al. 2009; Müller et al. 2008; Hainz et al. 2007; Popov & Schultze 2008). On the other hand, elevation of IDO and kynurenine pathway activation may play a role in protecting the fetus from immune system attack by fostering feto-maternal tolerance (Sedlmayr 2007).

**HIV- and cancer-like immunosuppression by overactivation of IDO and kynurenine pathway**
____
____
In several forms of cancer and in several chronic infectious diseases, overactivation of inflammatory cytokines and IDO, depletion of tryptophan, and synthesis of kynurenines – individually or in combination – suppress the adaptive immune response by affecting
either T cells, antigen-presenting cells, or both. (MacKenzie et al. 2007).    Elevated IDO appears to play a role in upregulating Tregs in human lymphatic filariasis (Babu et al. 2006), a significant role in CD4+ T cell dysregulation in chronic human HCV infection (Larrea et al. 2007), causes significant suppression of CD4+ and cytotoxic T cells in the peripheral blood in chronic human HBV (Chen et al. 2009), appears to downregulate CD4+ effector T cells, increase Tregs, and increase the rate of apoptosis in CD8+ Tcells in SIV infection (Boasso et al. 2007; Boasso et al. 2009), inhibits CD4+ T-cell proliferation that characterizes HIV disease progression, and appears to limit proliferative and cytotoxic capacity of CD8+ T cells in HIV infection (Boasso et al. 2007b; Boasso et al. 2007c; Persidsky et al. 2006).

This same form of immunosuppression occurs in several malignancies, including breast cancer (Mansfield et al. 2009)
; acute myeloid leukemia (Curti et al. 2007; Curti et al. 2008; Chamuleau et al. 2008), ovarian carcinoma (Inaba et al. 2009, lung cancer Suzuki et al. 2009), endometrial cancer (Ino et al. 2008), pancreatic cancer (Witkiewicz et al. 2008), hepatocellular carcinoma (Pan et al. 2008), cutaneous melanoma (Polak et al. 2007).  The mechanisms involved in IDO/kynurenine pathway-mediated immunosuppression are being studied intensively, and are partially understood. 

Human dendritic cells that differentiate under elevated-IDO and/or low-tryptophan conditions show a reduced capacity to stimulate T helper (Th) cells (CD4+), and favor induction of Tregs (Brenk et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2008; Hill et al. 2007). The reduced proliferation of CD4+ T cells and increased induction of Tregs would be systemic (Brenk et al. 2009), and therefore measurable in the peripheral serum. Similarly, in human fibroblasts, elevated IDO and kynurenine pathway activation suppresses proliferation of CD8+ T cells, and to a lesser extent CD4+ T helper cells (Forouzandeh et al. 2008).  The molecular effect of tryptophan depletion and/or exposure to tryptophan catabolites on CD8+ T cells appear to be associated with limited proliferative response and ability to exhibit cytotoxic function (Boasso et al. 2007b). The reduced proliferation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells is only partially measurable in peripheral serum, because it also occurs in the local microenvironment where elevated IDO activates the kynurenine pathway (Brenk et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2008; Hill et al. 2007).  

Liu et al. have recently shown that while elevated IDO significantly reduced the number of proliferating CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in an experimental rat lung allograft, those levels were still significantly higher than found in normal lungs. Yet the CD8+ T cells that did proliferate were significantly stripped of their cytotoxic capacity in microenvironments with elevated IDO, despite remaining viable (Liu et al. 2009).  

In patients with chronic hepatitis B, elevated IDO is responsible for immunotolerance against HBV, closely correlates with HBV viral load, and is negatively correlated with CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T cells, and with the ratio of CD4/CD8 (Liu et al. 2009). In patients with chronic hepatitis C -- which is characterized by weak T-cell responses -- IDO expression in liver tissue, and serum kynurenine tryptophan ratio -- a reflection of IDO activity -- are significantly elevated (Larrea et al. 2007). In hepatitis C-infected chimpanzees, hepatic IDO expression decreased in animals that cured the infection, while it remained high in those that progressed to chronicity (Larrea et al. 2007). Elevated IDO and kynurenine-tryptophan ratio are strongly correlated to viral load and immunosuppressive regulatory T cell (Treg) levels in the spleen and gut during progressive simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection (Boasso et al. 2007). Elevated IDO and depleted tryptophan also induce suppression of cytotoxic T-cells in mice infected with malaria (Tetsutani et al. 2007).   

Inhibition of IDO as an adjunct to treatment has proven remarkably effective in animal studies of SIV and HIV infection, and several forms of cancer. In SIV-infected monkeys experiencing only a partial response to retroviral therapy, partial blockade of IDO with retroviral therapy reduced plasma and lymph node SIV to undetectable levels (Boasso et al. 2009). In a murine model of HIV-1 encephalitis, the IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan (1-MT) enhances the generation of HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, leading to elimination of HIV-1-infected macrophages in brains of the treated mice (Potula et al. 2005). In mouse models of transplantable melanoma and breast cancer, 1-MT, in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, significantly inhibited tumor growth and enhanced survival of treated mice (Hou et al. 2007). Yet because of its poor solubility, 1-MT has restricted clinical application (Hou et al. 2007, van der Sluijs et al. 2006, Popov et al. 2008). Inhibition of IFN-gamma, with resulting inhibition of  IDO, also reverses T cell unresponsiveness in mice injected with staphylococcal enterotoxin A (Kim et al. 2009).   


This same immunosuppressive mechanism is likely occurring in advanced Lyme disease of long-term duration, since tryptophan is depleted, IDO is very likely overactivated, and CNS QUIN is significantly elevated – “dramatically” so in neuroborreliosis where “the severity of the infection and [inflammatory] immune stimulation [was not yet] intense.” (Halperin & Heyes 1992). [Cite studies on Th1/Th2, Treg, and CD8+ ratios in chronic Lyme]. Because cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages play a central role in attacking intracellular infection, systemic or local microenvironment suppression/deactivation of CD8+ and CD4+ Th1 lymphocytes may largely explain the persistence of intracellular B. burgdorferi. Likewise, suppression of CD4+ Th2 cells would help explain the persistence of extracellular B. burgdorferi. 

This could also explain the poor sensitivity of the CD57+ NK T-cell count as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator, despite its apparent specificity in Lyme disease and/or TBIs. 

Moreover, because lysis of B. burgdorferi provokes inflammation (cites), antibiotics are likely to cause further activation of IDO and the kynurenine pathway, which would compromise the immune response against both intracellular and extracellular infection. Of course, antimicrobials can be effective in Lyme disease that is not too far advanced, as demonstrated by Halperin & Heyes (1992). But in cases of long-term infection, this would help explain why advanced Lyme disease is incurable using antimicrobials without a targeted, anti-inflammatory adjunct.  Plenty of anecdotal evidence for herx-like reactions in treating babesiosis. Look for studies on this in treating babesiosis and malaria. Elevated IDO and depleted tryptophan induce suppression of cytotoxic T-cells in mice infected with malaria (Tetsutani et al. 2007).   

**Suppressing TNF-alpha and IDO as well as NMDA Receptor**
____
____
Inflammation may have a protective role and promote regeneration of damaged neurons. We do not yet know how to achieve a ""balanced"" inflammation. Because some novel anti-inflammatory treatment might have detrimental consequences, carefully monitoring disease progress in patients treated with this category of drugs is indispensable (Aktas et al. 2007; Bransfield ). However, as inflammation, IDO activation, and CNS QUIN levels subside, so do Lyme disease symptoms. Since short-course, low-dose ketamine infusions suppress inflammation for days or weeks, and if ketamine is infused only symptomatically, the immune balance should not be skewed in an anti-inflammatory direction for any extended period.   Role of tryptophan starvation in controlling specific infections. Higher degree of tryptophan depletion required to deactivate T cells than to fight off these infections.  

By reducing CNS inflammation, ketamine should counteract IDO/tryptophan/kynurenine-mediated induction of Tregs,suppression of CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells.  Autoimmunity in Lyme-MS, Lyme-arthritis after “adequate” antibiotic therapy...Only one in vivo mouse study so far to support this, but possibility that lysis-induced inflammation can trigger or exacerbate autoimmune response by further activating IDO and kynurenine pathway... ..

Long-term, daily use of high-dose ketamine -- urinary tract damage, ulcerative  cystitis, disabling frequent urination... Controlled effectively by author by Class IV 7.5 W, 980 nm medical near-infrared laser.Mimicry of schizophrenicsymptoms by blockage of NMDA receptor should not be an issue in Lyme disease if usedsymptomatically, since NMDA receptor is overactivated. However, since the NMDA receptor is generallyunderactivated in schizophrenia, and because the Halperin & Heyes study showing dramatically elevated quinolinic acid (NDMA receptor antagonist) in Lyme neuroborreliosis involved a small and heterogeneous group of patients, ketamine should be used very cautiously in Lyme-schizophrenia. 

Symptom reduction, neuroprotection, etc. . . .  Because ketamine aids in cerebral delivery of IV antibiotics by ameliorating cerebral hypoperfusion, and may also ameliorate a major form of immunosuppression, the duration of antibiotic treatment and time to cure should be decreased in Lyme disease patients using ketamine. Ketamine also offers hope for late-stage patients who cannot tolerate antibiotic-induced symptom exacerbation.

Amyloid peptide Aβ 1-42 – induces lDO expression and a significant increase in the production of QUIN by human macrophages and microglia in Alzheimer’s. (Guillemin et al. 2003). 

Interferon-β (IFN-β) – in multiple sclerosis, pharmacologically relevant concentrations of IFN-beta are able to induce the kynurenine pathway in human macrophages. (Amirkhani et al. 2005; Gullemin et al. 2001) 

Interferon-γ (IFN- γ) – very potetently activates IDO

____
_____
•Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase drug targets (Regulator: Determines Neurotoxicity and Neuroprotection potential. Can metabolize neurotoxic 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine which is downstream; Deficency due to cytokines can cause a shift to Kynurenic Acid; although neuroprotetive it can cause cognitive deficits including issues w/ visospatial working memory and predictive pursuit; inhibitors help neurodegenerative diseases and excitotoxicity but have potential cognitive side effects due to an increase in KYN Acid)
____
(QUIN causes brain lesions. So my thinking is that the body effort to combat the excitotoxicity w/ a greater production in KYN acid. KYN Acid is elevated in Schizophrenia, Autism and to a lesser degree Aspergers Syndrome.)


 * Rosmarinic Acid (Found in Lemon Balm) IDO inhibitor possibly due to COX-2 inhibition; unsure how potent)

 * Curcumin (Safest bet; not sure how potent at reducing QUIN)

 * COX-2 inhibitors (Not that potent; potential side effects; down-regulates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase [IDO], leading to a reduction in kynurenine levels as well as reducing proinflammatory cytokine activity)

 * Norharmane (B-Carboline; found in Syrian Rue psychedelic, very POTENT at inhibiting QUIN but of course with potential side effects; safety issues)

 * NMDA Antagonists (Magnesium, Low dose Ketamine, memantine; does nothing to inhibit QUIN production but can protect against its excitotoxicity due to NMDA antagonism; 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, MK-801 and memantine, can partially decrease QUIN toxicity; (iii) kynurenic acid can decrease LDH release in a linear manner, whereas picolinic acid does the same but non-linearly; and (iv) 1-methyl tryptophan is effective in decreasing QUIN release by the rodent microglial cell line BV-2 and thus protects NSC-34 from cell death. There is currently a lack of effective treatment for ALS and our in vitro results provide a novel therapeutic strategy for ALS patients.

 * Nicotinylalanine (Inhibitor of Kynurenine Hysroxylase, which reduces QUIN production in favor of Kynurenic Acid, potential cognitive side effects)

 * 1-Methyltryptophan (Racemic compound that weakly inhibits indoleamine dioxygenase,[20] but is also a very slow substrate.[21] The specific racemer 1-methyl-D-tryptophan [known as indoximod] is in clinical trials for various cancers.)

 * Epacadostat and navoximod (GDC-0919) (potent inhibitors of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme and are in clinical trials for various cancers.[22] BMS-986205 is also in clinical trials for cancer.[23]

 * Interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Nitric Oxide (IDO-1 downregulation; however, it should be noted that nitric oxide does not inhibit IDO-1 in microglia cells.

 * Astrocytes (Neuroprotective by minimizing QUIN accumulation and maximizing synthesis of KYNA) (Mycoplasma, Borrelia Burgdorferi the casuative agent of Lyme Disease have an affinity towards destroying these glial cells)
What increases the production of QUIN?

 * Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and to a lesser extent IFN-β, IFN-α, tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), platelet activating factor, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, HIV-1 proteins Nef and Tat and amyloid beta peptide 1–42 can lead to upregulation of the cellular expression of IDO-1 with consequent increased QUIN production, among others.

 * Niacin is an indirect IDO-1 inhibitor. Instead of taking tryptophan, niacin is used to shift tryptophan metabolism away from the kynurenine pathway.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195227/

 * Cytokines may also act synergistically to increase QUIN production. For example, this happens with TNF-α and IFN-γ leading to enhanced IDO-1 activity and increased QUIN by secretion from macrophages. Seen in neurobrreliosis, CNS Lyme Disease.

 * Presence of infiltrating macrophages and/or activated microglia, astrocytes become indirectly and paradoxically neurotoxic through the production of large concentrations of KYN that can be secondarily metabolized as extra substrate by neighbouring monocytic cells to synthesize QUIN.

>QUIN is produced and released by infiltrating macrophages and activated microglia, the very cells that are prominent during neuroinflammation.

>QUIN acts as a neurotoxin, gliotoxin, proinflammatory mediator, pro-oxidant molecule and can alter the integrity and cohesion of the Blood Brain Barrier.

Lose of BBB integrity is probably how I got neuroborreliosis in the first place.

It is well known that activated resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages are the major source of QUIN within the brain

Neurons within the hippocampus, striatum and neocortex are sensitive to QUIN, but cerebellar and spinal cord neurons are less sensitive. These differences in regional sensitivity most likely relate to differences in NMDAR configuration [78–83]. We recently demonstrated that, by using a combination of three NMDAR antagonists, we could fully protect motor neurons from QUIN excitotoxicity.

QUIN can increase glutamate release by neurons, inhibit its uptake by astrocytes and inhibit astroglial glutamine synthetase leading to excessive microenvironment glutamate concentrations and neurotoxicity.

Dysfunctional states of distinct steps of the L-Tryptophan catabolism / kynurenine pathway (e.g. kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, anthranilic acid, 3 -Hydroxykynurenine) have been described for a number of disorders, e.g.

"I tried taking Alpha GPC because of its reported cognitive benefits and potential to elevate mood and motivation. I've heard for some it may do the opposite regarding mood.

Personally, I encountered a side effect I haven't seen mentioned. It made me feel drunk. Slightly inebriated in a way where it was hard to focus, sluggish/drifting thoughts, and induced solid brain fog. I take pride in being able to react to things quickly being an ex-tournament level gamer and I felt this gave me a noticeable, temporary decline.

I tried taking it with Phenylpiracetam hoping to counter the effects and it magnified them further. I just felt like a legitimate sog brained moron.

"One issue I've found with this subreddit is that many supplement experience reports are manic rants about how some supplement has cured them of every ill they've ever had in 5 minutes, or how some fairly benign supplement has surely ruined them for life.

But we know from our own usage  that most supplement usage ends up being meh.  I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a weekly supplement experience thread.  Where once a week a compound is picked and people report their experiences.

"Hi guys! New here in reddit, I just started having some nootropics after all the good things i read about them cause i though it could help me with my work as a music composer. I've been having a Aniracetam + Phenibut + Citicoline Stack for 3 days now and Today i tryed my first dose of Modafinil (200mg) + Aniracetam (1000mg) + Citicoline (250mg).

I gotta say i was expecting a super noticeable effect the first day and i was surprised by how ""mellow"" it was, although i was more awake, focused and ""probably"" a bit more motivated , i wasn't really feeling a super difference...

I pushed the aniracetam dose to 2000mg (2x 1000) and it kept me going during the day, but i also felt my legs and back a bit tired.. 

Definitely interesting, cause i really spent the whole day working with no interest on stopping or laying in the sofa to do nothing... As I sometimes do.. But not an extreme ""lit"" sensation.. 

Today i tryed 200mg of Modafinil, similar alertness effect, less tired feeling than with Aniracetam, more action and speed, but definitely less social, more irritated when my wife interrupted my work for some really not interesting issue... Heheh

Then i added 1000mg Aniracetam in the middle of the day, felt more relaxed, with same awakeness. 

I read the effects of aniracetam are best noticeable after a few days/weeks of use. Is that true? 

I'll keep experimenting during the week and let you know. 

If you suggest some other stack or dosage let me know!! 

Thanx!!

"I am on my fifth day of uridine. I am going to take 350mg twice a day with food for the first two weeks.

First, I read up on this and was anticipating mood elevation and improved memory. It's real. Uridine and placebo are a great combo, and I don't care which is which.

Notes from day 3: I slept better than usual last night. Today I woke up and felt like I wanted to DO SOMETHING with my Labor Day weekend. Had this been last weekend, I would have laid around in bed depressed until I decided to go to the gym. I went down to a specific supermarket and bought food for the rest of the week (three hour errand). I came back, cleaned the greasiest cooking pan in the oven (never been done before), made organic coffee for coffee enemas (the first time I have ever brewed my own coffee like this, although the coffee has been in my cupboard for this specific purpose for the last nine months), and I'm playing chef with brown rice, lean meat, and mixed vegetables. I feel clearheaded and bubbly, like the uridine is beneath the surface waiting to percolate up.

Uridine feels too good to be true, because if I stay this motivated, it will be equivalent to the first time I was prescribed stimulant medication for ADHD and then sent out 1000 resumes/cover letters. I found a job in a terrible economy with stimulant medication. I am excited for this.

Day 4: I cleaned the entire oven. Only the kitchen and bathroom tile floors are left. Someone with whom I am working stopped by. With a level of self-awareness, I watched myself explain three different levels of complexity all at the same time. Imagine this: ""Animals have cell membranes. Plants have cell walls. Animal cell membranes are composed of phospholipids. Phosphatydl-serine enhances memory. Phosphatydl-serine is actually prescribed by psychiatrists for this specific reason in cases of brain injury. Likewise, phosphatydl-choline is an antidepressant. Phosphatydl-choline is composed of three elements: uridine, choline, and DHA. First, uridine is one of four nucleosides found in all RNA, like adenine and guanine. I don't remember the other two, but there are four. Second, phosphatydl-choline needs choline, which is found in eggs. Choline was once a B vitamin until it was found to be inessential and de-classified. Eggs are brain food for this reason. Third, DHA is the omega-3 fatty acid that makes fish oil so popular. In short, with enough fish oil and eggs, the uridine packs a potent anti-depressant punch. I really feel that much better, and I'm pretty sure it's not placebo."" So, this begins with talk about cell membranes, moves to the dietary pre-requisites of phosphatydl-choline, and then discusses each element individually, only to conclude in a way that invokes the beginning. With uridine, you hold three layers of thought in your head at once, tie it all together, and it rolls of your golden tongue. Admittedly, this is after I hit the elliptical to get blood flowing to my brain, downed a large amount of caffeine (to which I was more sensitive), and chewed a couple pieces of nicotine gum. I was well aware that this is me at the top of my game.

Day 5: My eight hour shift at work today flew by. I took an expected size of lunch in to work and only ate half of that. I am forcing myself to eat dinner. It reminds me of prescribed stimulant medication.

Given that the difference between responders and non-responders seems to be the rest of your stack, I'll explain my miracle result stack:

"(Disclaimer: this post was originally posted on r/Entrepreneur, but I received a lot of requests to post on this subreddit)

I recently read the art of learning by josh waitzkin, and was immediately taken aback by the chapter on building triggers and inducing flow states. If you haven't read the book Josh helps a business executive who is struggling to stay focused in meetings by building routines that can eventually be decompressed to triggers that induce states of flow for stressful situations.

I was so inspired that I built my own, and the results have been extraordinary. As a test I wanted to calm the anxiety i sometimes experience when flying. I travel a lot, however, I don't go to the countries that are easy to get to. I spend a lot of time travelling to West Africa. Nigeria, Benin, Liberia and Ghana. And sometimes I get anxious when flying on the planes to get to these countries. I decided to build triggers that would help me to move past the anxiety when it comes.

The first step is to identify an activity you purely do for fun. One that when you are doing just feels like the world is completely quiet. For me, this is either rock climbing, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or surfing.

So for one month, I would perform my routine in the hopes that I could then anchor these routines to the flow states I find myself entering whenever I am performing any of the activities mentioned above.

The routines I chose to perform were chosen because I knew that each one is valuable when doing high-performance strenuous activity. But having said that whatever your routine is, it doesn't really matter. As long as it leaves you feeling energized after doing them.

My first activity was some Wim Hof breathing. This I did for 10 minutes as I always noticed a clear head and energized body when I completed this exercise. Also flooding your body with oxygen has so many physiological benefits.

I would then stretch for 10 minutes focusing on realising my spine, legs and shoulders. I would then have an ice cold shower for 3 minutes.

I would then go and write one thing I was grateful for on that day. And then listen to the same playlist as I drove to get to the activity of the day.

What I noticed was that whenever I was grappling or climbing, I was so acutely focused and intentional while practising I was often in disbelief that the class was either over or that 2 hours had flown by in the blink of an eye. My ability to perform more difficult manoeuvres also had a significant improvement as well as the speed at which I was learning new skills.

I then transitioned to this routine every time I had to fly. I haven't been anxious anytime at all when flying since I started doing this. It has been completely removed from the sphere of experience. My initial expectation was that I would still get anxious on the plane when we hit some turbulence. But nothing, the state of the routine was with me throughout the flight.

What I am focusing on now, is reducing the routine as Josh does in the book, eventually being able to switch on this ability with a single deep breath, to be called upon whenever I find myself not present and distracted.

I will post again once I have successfully done this, calling upon flow states whenever needed in business and in life.

Hope this helps some of you out there: Discipline is Freedom.",15,1536108022.0,Nootropics,9cxce4,62,How I create triggers that put me in a state of FLOW.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9cxce4/how_i_create_triggers_that_put_me_in_a_state_of/

"After quitting drinking I've been trying to find things to fill the void it's created. Alcohol worked great for making me feel like taking on the world but.. physically was unable to.

Klonopin gives me a weird ""cold fresh clean sheets"" snuggly feeling that is so relaxing it beats my motivation to death by making me just feel chill, even though I know I need to get stuff done.

After the cessation of alcohol I began drinking caffeine loaded drinks non stop, probably to fill the habit of drinking beer 3 nights a week like clockwork. For caffeine it's maybe 5-7 a day since it isn't impairing. It gets me wired and working but that same motivation and quick thinking means my anxiety dials up. Soon enough its working against me by introducing doubt, paranoia, and millions of reasons not to do whatever I'm trying to do. I just say forget it.

But I recently noticed the combination of Klonopin and caffeine created a motivated but also less anxious state, like they cancel out the bad effects of eachother. I'm still unsure of the dosage, but right now its just 0.5mg Klonopin and 40-80mg of caffeine (diet soda/coffee). Any more Klonopin and I get slouchy lazy and sluggish unless I'm in a social situation.


**My main question** I've grown increasingly curious about nicotine and Juuls are pretty damn cheap. Since my work involves a lot of communication, anything held in my mouth isn't ideal (gum, lozenges). The patches scare me because of the horror stories I've heard. My only route that at least appears safer than alcohol would be vaping while I work (sat, sun, wednesday).

I've smoked cigarettes, cigars, vapes, sporadically multiple times a week for about a month and then just stopped. I always had too many other things going on for me while out to notice their direct effect.

To those of you familiar with nicotine, how do you feel it would fit into what I'm going for? Slight non impairing euphoria, anti-anxiety, and motivation? How long does it last? 30 minutes at least? This is assuming no addiction or real tolerance, of course.

"I used Noopept in pillform with 10mg two years ago and my route of action then was half a pill sublingual, since oral only gave me a big brain fog and nothing else.
The effects I got from sublingual Noopept was advanced and quickened train of thoughts, I knew exactly what to say immediately in conversations. Otherwise I'm quite boring to talk to unless I'm well read in the subject. I suck at small talk, and I don't really like it either but with Noopept sublingually the small talk came easy even to me.

I decided to try Noopept again but this time as a nasal spray from a reputable source. I decided on intranasal route of action due to higher bioavailability which means I can dose lower than 5mg.
Unfortunately the effects I got from intranasal administration was very unlike the effects with a sublingual administration.

In low doses it makes my 'tired' vision clear up after just a few seconds of administration and it's as if I can see clearly after a full night of very good sleep. I guess this is what people call HD vision. This is all I get from a low dose, 1-2 sprays per nostril, 1.5mg per spray.

In higher doses, maybe 5-8 sprays per nostril spread out over two hours I felt a bit euphoric, higher appreciation for music which I have only ever gotten from MDMA, amphetamines and in certain sober states of mind.
Also at the end I almost got a little manic, not much but I experienced a few intense moments of happiness felt by a short wave of sadness. What goes up must come down or something?

So all in all these are the only effects I get from Noopept. The duration of intranasal Noopept is also a lot less longer than with sublingual administration, but that was to be expected. I'm definitely going to order some more Noopept but either in pill or capsule form so I can let it smelt under the tongue. It's too bad they put so much fillers in capsules. Maybe I'll just get it in powder form, not as easy as handle as putting a pill or emptying a capsule under your tongue.

"Title says most of it.

I derped this morning and sublingually took 100mg of Noopept + 300mg of Alpha whatever from Nootropics depot. About 15 minutes in most of the powder had mixed with saliva and I got sick of the taste so I swallowed it. The google told me I had miscalculated my measurements. Ate a large, balanced meal after and went about my day expecting a wild ride of temporary Finding Dory-tier stupidity.

I honestly don't feel any different. I have felt some lethargy and brain fog but that was present from the moment I woke up & I'm pretty sure is related to taking Trazodone for sleep last night for the first time (50mg). No focus, no short term memory/mammary loss.

**The only things I noticed:**

1) I had a bit of tingling in my forehead for a few moments that sort of felt like a tension headache and then nothing, 20 minutes or so after ingestion. The tingling left for an hour and appeared later for about the same length of time then left to never return. 

2) I had unprecedented muscle control in my workout today. Cable cross movements were smoother & controlled - I tend to have a bit of 'waving' normally. I just recently started training my back properly and the first two workouts I had huge issues engaging my Lats over my auxiliary muscles, but this time it was **perfect**. This also could be attributed to CNS adaptation from my previous two workouts.

1) Why wasn't I a goldfish?

from what I've red on NootropicsExpert ([nootropicsexpert.com/sulbutiamine](https://nootropicsexpert.com/sulbutiamine)) I understand it's just well bioavailable form of vitamin B1. And this vitamin basically transport nutriens into brain cells, which they need for proper function. 

What I don't understand is, why people report tollerance and even addiction to this substance. If it's natural vitamin which just gives cell needed nutriens, how can one build tollerance and stop getting effects from it?

"**Not recommending nicotine use to anyone. This is an individual decision that one must make themselves.**

It took me several years to finally get it through my head that caffeine and me just do not get along. After having an anxiety attack during work yesterday thanks to consuming too much coffee, which for me was a little under 200mgs, I decided to have no caffeine whatsoever today (well, unless you count that small piece of dark chocolate that I had for lunch).

During my work breaks, I vaped a low dose of nicotine, and it cleared me up, didn't disrupt me nearly as much as caffeine does, and I made it through alright.

All in all I'm impressed. That said, I'm perfectly aware of how addictive this chemical is, but honestly? I don't feel the slightest bit of addiction to nicotine and could drop it easily. I have many times before in the past, and if I see enough reason to, I'll drop it again. But right now, it's working so much better than caffeine ever has for me. Caffeine ruins my performance, whereas nicotine seems to even me out.

I haven't seen a lot of evidence that has convinced me nicotine is this evil, horrible drug outside of smoking as an ROA.

Even so, while I enjoy the clarity that it gives me, it **is** like any other substance in that tolerance can and will develop.

I'm still not entirely sure why nicotine, despite being a stimulant, isn't impacting me nearly as much as even a half cup of coffee, which can send me to a bad place quite easily.

I read a bit about the effects of antipsychotics in brain volume in the past (apparently they lead to loss of grey matter), and I'm concerned about this...

I recently started taking fish oil (I had taken it in the past too) and I'm planning on adding some probiotics (to see if my constipation and digestive issues get any better, as well as my mood) and I now was thinking about lion's mane (I have some turmeric with piperine and theanine with and without caffeine that I still have to try).

I've found something in Amazon that has a blend of different mushrooms:

\- Lion's mane

\- Lingzhi mushroom

\- Cordyceps

\- Jew's ear

\- Shiitake

&#x200B;

And I don't know if such a thing could be more beneficial than just taking lion's mane.

What do you think?

Lions Mane mushrooms (or their extract) has been shown to increase Nerve Growth Factor in the brain, displaying an increased rate at which new neural/synaptic connections are formed. What would the implications of this be towards synaptic pruning (especially the period we go through in adolescence causing the loss of many unessential memmories)? 

Could this mushroom, which has many well documented health benefits to our brain, neutralize the processess of our minds slowly cutting away older/less used synaptic connections.

It is often called a nootropic and used to improve cognitive ability. Comparatively, If these effects build up over time, wouldn'nt the person who had used Lion's Mane the longest (accounting for dosage) see the most benefits? How much more efficient than the average man's cognitive ability could be achieved if someone used very specific doses of this as well as other Nootropics to aid in the creation of useful synaptic pathways in the brain. This would also ensure that the brain had all the high quality protiens, vitamins, and everything else it needs to grow and improve.

"Firstly, I'm on mobile so apologies in advance if this post lacks organization. 

I was doing some research on meditation and among a plethera of changes in the brain I saw that over time it reduces the ammount of grey matter in the amygdala. As a result of this your amygdala won't light up as much in response to typical stressors and your anxiety would be lessened. 

Now onto how it could relate so semax. From reading around on this subreddit and other sources of nootropic information I've found that semax works by inducing, or mimicking (I can't remember which) a state of stress and your body responds to this by bumping up performance. Because semax seems to benefit from your bodies reaction to stress, would meditation mitigate it's effects, or am I looking at this in the wrong way and they would, in fact, be synergistic?

Also somewhat related to both meditation and semax, as they both seem to tackle stress in different ways, shouldn't they, in theory, allow for an easier transition into flow state. Meditation is already linked heavily with the flow state, but I'm wondering if the reason that these both help induce a state of flow is because flow is often triggered by optimal levels of stress and difficulty related to a task (High difficulty + Low stress = flow state).",3,1535622045.0,Nootropics,9bfdkg,2,Could meditation dull the effects of Semax?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9bfdkg/could_meditation_dull_the_effects_of_semax/

"I tried nootropics based on the positivity and enthusiasm I've encountered on this subreddit and out of a general desire to improve my mental function. What I got was something that started out as largely pleasant and experimental with caffeine and L Theanine but ended up playing itself out as a nightmare scenario. When you try Alpha GPC, a commonly used nootropic you may very well experience the following combo as I did, extreme horniness followed shortly by becoming an emotionless robot thereby proceeded by all the emotionality coming at you at once but only the negative ones, i.e. depression. Alpha GPC is supposed to help with memory and focus, how did it have all these unintended and seemingly random knock on effects that seemed to have no real connection to the intended effects? If anything else, I've come away with a new found admiration for the complexity of nature and the human brain and interconnectedness of it all as it seems you can't alter one portion without having a number of random effects occur that play huge roles in your personality. But even with Alpha GPC out of the list, you can have dizziness, nausea, mood alteration and some serious cognitive decline with a number of other nootropics such as Bacopa. Which with Ashwagandha may very well contain heavy metals that will cause serious cognitive decline and possibly even death with continued usage. Case in point, the dangers of pursuing this is NOT touted as strongly as they should be because the internet is designed algorithmically and fundamentally to tell people what they want to hear and silence dissenting voices and free, rational and critical thought. r/Nootopics fits the bill on this 100% and if you are here, I felt some sense of responsibility to forewarn others of exactly what they're getting themselves into lest there be consequences that can't be undone.

"tl;dr - Carbon 60 feels dopaminergic, is as strong as 300 mg Wellbutrin, and gave me intense nightmares.

I have been on homemade c60 for a few months now. I don't know how many milligrams it is per day. It's kept in an opaque container to keep light from hitting it.

The honeymoon is over. I think it's equivalent in strength either to Wellbutrin or to methyl-B12 with L-tyrosine, all of which I consider appropriate to discuss as nootropics. It's like there is an increase in dopamine, which enhances instinctive motivation.

In the first two weeks, I noticed many effects.

1 - At first, I noticed a distinct, calm (anxiolytic), clearheaded, optimistic sense of wellbeing (euthymia). That effect never went away, but I did partially adjust to it as a new, baseline normal. It made me a touch more ""Go Get 'Em! Carpe Diem!"" as if I were 25 years old all over again.

2 - My endurance in exercise increased substantially. I do cardio workouts on the elliptical machine. I had to increase the level of resistance by two units over two weeks after the c60.

3 - My sleep cycle adjusted to waking up at 4am. I couldn't wait to wake up in the morning and take my full stack of nutraceuticals and nootropics plus c60. It was a muted rush, for which it was well worth going to bed early. I started going to bed at 8pm and waking up at 4 am to go exercise. The first thing I did in the morning, like an addict, was take two droppers full of c60. There was definitely a reinforcement effect with it. It is a morning supplement.

4 - I had vivid, vivid nightmares. Imagine that in all dreaming there is a constant, like the speed of light. That constant is the difference in plotline from one frame of the dream to the next frame of the dream. My dreams caromed wildly from point A, to point B, to point C, to point D all in a couple of seconds. The constant is the intensity of flux in the dream, like a roller coaster. It sucks being thrown off these roller coasters.

5 - More, the dreams were emotionally charged. Imagine difficult situations.  I haven't had a similar nightmare in over a month now. They went away.

6 - My family works in healthcare. They believe that there exists both degenerative change and regenerative change. Regenerative change can reach its climax in a ""healing crisis,"" their theory, not mine. After we started drinking freshly squeezed vegetable juice, my father went through a period of sickness where it seemed he was much worse off, not any better. Fresh vegetable juice produced a ""healing crisis.""

My father is also on c60 and said he had emotionally charged dreams. The nightmares were another form of healing crisis as far as he was concerned.

7 - I would sleep lightly, wake up at night startled, and hit my head against the wall often. This hasn't happened in at least a month now.",15,1535527752.0,Nootropics,9b3z4u,10,Carbon 60 (C60): Equivalent to Wellbutrin or both methyl-B12 and L-tyrosine,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9b3z4u/carbon_60_c60_equivalent_to_wellbutrin_or_both/
"just like the title states. sometimes fasoracetam does what most racetams do for me - close to nothing/maybe placebo/maybe mild anxiety relief/only noticeable when combining with other drugs. however, other times, fasoracetam just makes me feel... weird. kinda like phenibut, but not fun. just the dizzy-but-not-really effects of what I'm guessing to be GABA-B activity...? fuzzy.

it honestly feels reminiscent of when I took some bad ketamine that was cut with what I believe to be xylazine. that took me about a week to get back to baseline.

this has happened to me with faso before, and the last time this happened I didn't feel quite right for about 5 days after taking it (dose was between 10-20mg, just that one day). cognition, anxiety, depression, all of that remained relatively fine, and that is also true for today - I don't feel spacey or anxious or anything. just... a bit... off, and really regretting taking it this morning. I'm wondering if I will feel this way for the whole week, like the last time faso weirded my synapses. I'd really rather not, argh.

has this happened to anyone else? does fasoracetam make anyone else feel weirdly dizzy-but-not-really and just ""off""? it's not dysphoric, it's just *off* and I'd rather not feel this way. am I just a freak of nature?

does anyone know how to *stop* feeling this way? I dosed a bit of noopept in the afternoon but I can't say if that did anything at all. rats!

"Hi, on top of my usual Perika, I've just ordered 
[California Gold Nutrition, St. John's Wort Extract, EuroHerbs] from Iherb. I think Californian Gold is an own brand from Iherb but I could be wrong.

Ingredients per one capsule (300mg):

*St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.,) Extract (flowering tops) [0.3% Hypericins & 2% Hyperforins]*

Compared to Perika (one capsule 300mg):

*St. John's Wort Extract WS 5570 (stem, leaf, flower) patented and standardized to contain a minimum level of 2% hyperforin*

So the composition looks similar. The difference is that Perika is made with a patented extract, but it's also twice as expensive.

I do notice that I have a weird reaction to coffee though - it calms me down, but also makes me feel kind of lethargic and sleepy sometimes. L-theanine seems to exacerbate the drowsy feeling, although I haven't tried this combo often enough to know for sure. 

I know that this reaction to coffee and caffeine can be indicative of ADD.

As a creative person, this is a *huge* red flag for me.

"Around 2007, I had an executive position on a website that was popular among people who trade the markets. The pressure and intensity of my work was brutal. To stay on top of things I tried, Nootropics. Piracetam was my main go-to Noot. Back then, I didn't think it helped much. Since then, I have primarily taken Aniracetam and Phenylpiracetam...following Dave Asprey's advice in his book Headstrong. Honestly, the overall impact was not all that noticeable. I also sometimes use 1mg Nicotine Lozenges occasionally.

Recently, after listening to a number of podcasts from Nootropics pioneer Steven Fowkes (one of which was with Dave Asprey), in which he says he more or less chugs Piracetam in a drink, I decided to try that. I put a tablespoon to tablespoon-and-a-half into a flavored drink such as True Lemon.

I'm on my 3rd week of this regimen and my experience currently is the same as it was when I started it. My mind gets into 6th gear. Motivation is increased. Writing and conversation flows. This is certaintly a better outcome than from any other Noot I've tried over the years...even though I had used Piracetam a decade ago with less than notworthy results. I atribute that to my using a lower dosage back then. Also, I just took it in one gulp. Maybe mixing it with a drink allows for better absorption.

I know some of you have mentioned similar experience, but I'm just stunned to find it in a substance that was really the first Noot I ever tried.

I've tried all of those substances (extended periods of abstinence, BPC-157, bromantane, memantine, uridine + alpha GPC + DHA (Mr. Happy Stack), NSI-189, phenylpiracetam, tianeptine, NMDA antagonists like agmatine and ketamine, etc). They all work to a certain extent, but nothing has worked better than 9-Me-BC. It regenerates dopaminergic neurons and there's a ton anecdotal evidence that people have been able to easily cut their AMPH dosage by half or more within a single week. I made a thread about it [here earlier to gather some experiences](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8wyauf/restoring_dopaminergic_system_with_9mebc/) and I highly recommend reading [this thread](https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/70561-9-me-bc-regeneration-of-dopaminergic-neurons/page-1) as well on top of all the threads on /r/Nootropics.

I've been using 15-30mg once a day in the mornings for only a week now and my 40mg Vyvanse dosage is back at full throttle. The magic is back - I'm literally back at stage 1 of [amphetamine the drug you love to hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stims/comments/4i6550/amphetamine_the_drug_you_learn_to_hate/). It's as if I took it for the first time, and honestly I think I'd prefer dropping to 20mg now. I used to take 80-160mg Vyvanse for a while too so I can attest to the fact that 9-Me-BC works. It's very easy to source online and has solid nootropic benefits too. The only thing I haven't tried in my repertoire is microdosing stims for sensitization but I'm not willing to take the risk plus I'm fairly sure that it won't even work as explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/94o8ry/the_truth_myth_about_dopamine_sensitization_from/). As of right now, I plan to keep using 15mg 9-Me-BC daily and using 20-40mg Vyvanse once a week instead.

If I were to rank effectiveness on tolerance reversal and repairing subjective damage from continued amph (ab)use it would go: 

9-MBC >>> Bromantane > BPC-157 >>> the rest. Highly recommended, this stuff instantly erases withdrawals and reverses tolerance - what more could you ask for?

**Caveat:** I'm not a doctor, I'm merely relaying my personal experience. 9-MBC isn't that well studied (so isn't most other nootropics either to be honest) and it has some possible risks such as DNA damage with excessive sunlight exposure. Do your own research. I haven't found any other side effects, just positives. This stuff probably also reduces prolactin which is why is also has potent aphrodisiac properties.

**EDIT:**

Please read through the comments on the /r/Stims thread and all the other posts on Reddit + Longecity regarding this substance. Given its potentially potent MAOI activity, it should be avoided in conjunction with stimulants and other substances that directly release/inhibit reuptake of monoamines. This is best used to completely withdraw from stimulants and reset tolerance (on top of all the nootropic and healing benefits).

**Further summary of benefits:**

>• enhances mood

>• enhances cognition, learning and memory (both working and long term)

>• enhances spatial memory and the movements

>• neuroprotective (especially in the hippocampus and the midbrain, and against PD - parkinson's disease)

>• neuroregenerative (especially in the hippocampus and the midbrain, and against PD)

**Mechanism of Action**

>• up-regulates, differentiates and protects dopaminergic neurons, dendrites and synapses, especially in the substantia nigra of the midbrain and in the hippocampus [1][2][6][7]

>• increases dopamine synthesis [1][7]

>• increases neurotrophins/neurotrophic factors (NGF, BDNF, CDNF [6], GDNF, SHH [5]) and decrease apoptic signals [6] (like caspase-3) [2]

>• decreases inflammation, preventing microglia proliferation and chemokine release [4], protecting against lipopolysaccharide toxicity [5] and reducing LDH [2][6] (lactate dehydrogenase) [7] reduces α-synuclein [4][5], the aggregation of which form insoluble fibrils (like lewy bodies), one of the causes of some neurodegenerative disorders, like PD and AD (alzheimer's disease)
increase TH [6] (tyrosine hydroxylase) expression and its transcription factors, and interacts with tyrosine kinases [4][5][7]. TH converts L-tyrosine to L-Dopa, needed for the synthesis of the catecholamines, especially dopamine

>• MAO-B inhibition [3], preventing the formation of neurotoxic substances, like DOPAC (from the dopamine metabolization), 6-OH-DA (oxydopamine), and MPDP⁺/MPP⁺ (from MPTP), the major cause of dopaminergic neurons death

>• increases/protects/recovers the NADH dehydrogenase (or ""complex I"" [6] which catalyzes the transfer of electrons between NADH and Co-Q10), enhancing the mithocondrial respiration chain [7]

>• increase ATP [6]

**Side Effects**

>• photo-sensitivity (DNA damage after UVA rays exposure) [8][9][10]

>• dopamine neurotoxicity with quantities over the maximum recommended [6] **(anyone know what this amount might be?)**

"We haven't had a thread on MK-677 in a while here now so I figured I'd make a new post and we can gather some updated experiences for nootropic purposes (cognition, sleep quality, mood, etc). I don't see why this wouldn't be allowed to discuss here since it doesn't violate any rules and this discussion pertains exclusively to its nootropic benefits as opposed to its PED benefits.

**In theory, MK-677 should increase learning and memory, be neuroprotective, increase mood and sense of well-being, and dramatically increase sleep quality.** [Here's a great primer](https://www.well-beingsecrets.com/mk-677-ibutamoren-benefits/#Improves_Cognitive_Function) and [here's a good anecdote.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/311eje/mk677_if_you_like_sleep_you_will_love_this/)

From the first link:

**Improves Cognitive Function**

>Ibutamoren is often used by individuals as a nootropic because of its relationship with the ghrelin receptor.

>This receptor is known to provide nootropic effects.

>The direct science defining the role of Ibutamoren in affecting human cognitive function does not yet exist, but two indirect methods that may explain how Ibutamoren can provide support to cognitive function have been observed.

>The first method via which Ibutamoren can possibly affect cognitive function is through the impact of IGF-1, a hormone that is known to be increased in individuals using Ibutamoren, on the individual’s capacity for memory and learning.

>Research performed at the Department of Endocrinology in the Netherlands provided an analysis of the role of IGF-1 in brain function.

>The subjects were 25 healthy men of an advanced age who had retained functional ability.

>Test subjects were given a battery of neuropsychological tests, some of the scores of which were expected to see a decline with age.

>Test results were supportive of the hypothesis that IGF-1 provided a defense from age-related cognitive decline, specifically in the category of information processing speed (18).

>One study published in the Journal of Molecular Psychiatry, and another performed at the Department of Biomedical Sciences in Fort Collins, Colorado, seem to mirror these findings (19, 20).

>The second mechanism by which Ibutamoren can affect cognitive function is by providing the improvement in the quality of sleep and promoting an increase in the duration of REM sleep cycles (21, 22).

>There was also a study done at the Merck Research Laboratories in North Wales, Pennsylvania that presented the question of low IGF-1’s connection to Alzheimer’s disease.

>In the study, 563 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s were randomly placed either into an experimental group that was given 25 mg of Ibutamoren daily or a placebo group.

>The observation lasted for a full 12-month period.

>The study was unable to prove that Ibutamoren possessed the ability to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s.

**Positive Effect on Sleep**

>Though unclear how, or to what extent, it has long been known that growth hormone plays a role in the regulation of sleep patterns.

>The Center for the Study of Biological Rhythms in Brussels, Belgium devised a study intended to answer lingering questions regarding MK-677’s effect on sleep patterns in human subjects.

>Eight younger adults aged 18-30, along with six older adults with ages ranging from 65-71, were selected for the double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

>In the younger patients, there was a 50% increase in stage four sleep and a 20% increase in REM sleep for subjects given MK-677, when compared to subjects that were given the placebo.

>Also, deviations from normal sleep occurred at a rate of only 8% in the study for the younger patients given MK-677, while the placebo group deviated from normal sleep at a rate of 42%.

>The older patients treated with MK-677 gained a 50% increase in REM sleep, as well as a decrease in the time it took for patients to fall into a deep sleep.

>Frequencies for normal sleep deviations also saw a decrease in older patients.

>The findings of the study suggest that MK-677 usage can improve sleep quality, while at the same time correcting age-related decline in growth hormone levels.

>Critics have complained that the results of one study are not proof enough of MK-677’s potential role in improving sleep quality, but researchers remain optimistic (17).

 

**There is a possible issue though with long-term use**: [Long acting Ghrelin mimetics (MK-677) = brain detrimental](http://anabolicminds.com/forum/igf-1-gh/283161-long-acting-ghrelin.html)

>Chronic (non-pulsed) Ghrelin agonists (ibutamoren mesylate (MK-0677): depression producing, anxiety producing, fear conditioning producing effects of chronic stress, potentially neurologically damaging.

In terms of dosage, you don't need to go above 10 mg to attain the nootropic and sleep benefits. Anecdotally, using 5 mg daily for a few days has notably increased my sense of well-being (feels anxiolytic), makes me wake up feeling better rested, gives me better looking skin that almost glows, and has helped me feel more recovered physically from lifting. Side effects: bloated my stomach and gave me crazy hunger, water retention of 8lbs which is 5% of my bodyweight, and makes me a bit lethargic during the day. Libido is also a bit down probably due to prolactin increase.

**An interesting addendum:** I have a friend who's successfully discontinued heavy benzo usage without any withdrawal symptoms whatsoever using MK-677 exclusively.

"I've tried dozens and dozens of different nootropics and I have to say that methylene blue is impressive. I've been using it for about 2-3 weeks now. And what I've noticed is a drastic decrease in ADHD symptoms, depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms. Possibly due to methylene blue's MAO inhibiting effects. I've also noticed an increase in verbal abilities. I just feel more confident and willing to tackle challenges.

 I still have some concerns about it. Anything that's powerful, like I think it is, has the ability to cause serious side effects. Methylene blue definitely has potential side effects, like serotonin syndrome, if it's mixed with serotonergic drugs. And blue pee if you mind that.

Since it's not an irreversible MAO I don't think it causes the ""cheese effect"", but that's not to say that it can't increase blood pressure significantly along with tyramine consumption. Luckily I already have a low tyramine diet that I can make a extremely low with a little modification. So that's not a deal breaker for me. It might be a deal breaker for a lot of people. I don't think we know how much methylene blue will mess with your blood pressure after you eat cheese or another tyramine containing food yet. It could be very significant.

I've tried various doses. From 10mg per day to 100 mg per day. When I was at the 100 mg range I started to get weird prickling sensations and anxious energy after a few days. So I lowered my dose to 30 mg, which seems to give largely the same benefits, without much of that sensation. Though weirdly there are many studies that use more than that without many reported issues.

For people who want to approach a drug seriously and cautiously, methylene blue is pretty interesting. I think there's a lot of threads out there where people seriously underdose methylene blue, to the point where it's unlikely that it significantly inhibits MAO and probably doesn't have much of an anti-oxidant effect. That's not necessarily bad, because it's less likely people will hurt themselves with it, but it also means that people aren't seeing the true potential (which necessarily comes with the risks associated with MAOIs).

Main downsides:     

* Possible side effects of MAOI - tyramine interaction, interaction with serotonergic drugs    
* Can be a bitch to cap wear gloves if you mess with it    
* Blue pee, a high enough dose can actually turn the inside of your toilet     slightly blue    
* May cause nervous energy especially at high doses    

Main upsides:

* Better mood    
* Clearer thinking    

I'll see how it goes from here, hopefully it doesn't lose its magic.

So maybe it's not the wisest idea but I'm very much considering placing another order with them. There is simply nowhere else to get either P21 nor phenylpiracetam hyrdazide, and I really really have wanted to try these two for a while now.

My main question is whether anyone has tried their P21 and/or their phenylpiracetam hydrazide, and if so, how your experience was with it.

Or if anyone has any feedback on how their orders/product have been from Nootropic Source in general, I'd be very interested in any and all reports/advice.

"Title says it all.. I'm trying to figure out if creatine could be classified as a NMDA antagonist.  [This study] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25555469) examined the effect of NMDA activation/inactivation on the tail suspension test in mice.  NMDA agonists seemed to abolish creatine's beneficial effects, while NMDA antagonists seemed to enhance it.

""In conclusion, the anti-immobility effect of creatine in the TST involves NMDAR inhibition and enhancement of NO levels accompanied by an increase in neural viability.""

[Another study] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10727643) says that creatine can protect against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity, while [this one] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15672208) says creatine lowers glutamate in Huntington's disease.  This would be why it enhances the effect of antidepressants.

Given that creatine can be an NMDA receptor inhibitor, and can lower glutamate levels, shouldn't we be much, much more careful about how we dose this?

Perhaps creatine is being over-dosed. 

Using creatine is great for wakefulness, but so is having the proper amount of glutamate in the brain, which is the main excitatory neurotransmitter.  Perhaps it is not the greatest to use creatine with something such as Huperzine A, or Memantine? 

In my opinion, 5/g day should not be this ""one size fits all"" dose for everyone, given this information",6,1535165241.0,Nootropics,9a024g,7,I need help making sense of some studies...is NMDA receptor inhibition involved in creatine's effects?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9a024g/i_need_help_making_sense_of_some_studiesis_nmda/
"This is going to sound odd for most people, and is likely to elicit a knee-jerk reaction first hand. Hear me out. I have scoured the internet for people experiencing the same as me, though they are few, there are some. I want to preface this by saying that whenever I introduce a new supplement or factor into my lifestyle, I isolate it and diligently log any noticed changes. I would say I am not one prone to placebo or making stuff up in my head, but this one might be odd enough for most of you to jump to the conclusion that I am. Alright..  


So I've experimented with creatine about three times the past 8 months. My body certainly responds to it; my endurance and strength goes up and I hold more water (about 7-8 lbs). So that's good, and that's what I expected from it. Now here's myriad of issues I seem to experience when using it; I become very short tempered and impatient, as well as incredibly lethargic. If I do normal dosing (3-5 gram/day) the symptoms will begin about one week in and increase in a linear fashion. When frontloading (with 20g/day), symptoms will come on way faster and by two weeks in I'll be walking around in a fog of tiredness and irritation. When symptoms are this bad, it takes 1½ weeks from stopping creatine for them to cease completely.  


Creatine is a molecule produced in the body.. and I also get it through my diet (though in smaller amounts).. so I'm scratching my head as to why *supplementing it*, albeit in a way higher dose than what my body is used to, should cause me such a strong reaction. I've tried tweaking my water intake as well as electrolytes to no avail, thinking that dehydration might've played a role in it. The longest I've gone supplementing the creatine was about 3-4 weeks (frontloading the first week) and so it might be a question of my body having to accustom to it somehow, though the symptoms are so unbearable that I'd rather just be without it.  


A lot of people online can certainly attest to it making them more short tempered, though with no real explanation why. If they inquire about it, they're usually shunned, which I think might be a product of the ""creatine=steroids"" craze that occurred a few years ago- now that anyone brings up any side effects regarding creatine supplementation, everyone is quick to tell them that they're a fucking idiot for believing it doing anything but modest changes to their physical performance..  


My personal take is that the irritability may be mediated by the modulation of cortisol, DHT, serotonin and dopamine.. though I have a hard time believing it could have such a big effect. Worth noting though, my cortisol is generally in the mid to lower range, and my body also seems to have an affinity for DHT. Cortisol reduction would explain the tiredness, while the DHT increase (if it actually occurs) would account for the aggression. I've also thought about the tiredness/irritability being a product of the body recalibrating it's water storages for a while after saturation is met (I'm a lean 220\~ lbs at 6'3) and thus, maybe the symptoms would subside if I were to continue beyond a months use.

I've also come to learn that supplementation of creatine is thought to optimize the methylation cycle (and I happen to have a couple of mutations in methylation-related genes) so I'm not sure how that would interplay with my situation- at first glance, it should only stabilize my mood and energy levels.

When I first took 600 Mg of NAC after 20 minutes I felt very overstimulated, intensely focused but also “out of it” and brain fogged. I also got a strange sensation in my eyes. Obviously this caused a little bit of anxiety, but I’m not sure if it was from the Supplement directly or indirectly from the symptoms of the Supplement. After this experience I did some research and saw some people reported similar feelings saying that they took smaller doses of NAC and it worked out better or they stopped all together because it could be a sign of heavy metal toxicity. I saw that people who have heavy metal toxicity also have adverse reactions to high sulfur foods, but I don’t have this. This makes me think that it may not be the heavy metal toxicity issue, but I could be wrong. 

This past weekend I decided to try again to see if maybe it was a one time thing and took 300 mg. This dose was less intense than before but was still very uncomfortable with the side effects. I decided to try one more time with 150mg and still had the same symptoms but obviously less intense and more manageable. At this dose I did notice a reduced heart rate and a somewhat relaxation feeling. It caused my mind to feel relaxed as well. I am interested in trying NAC again because of the 150mg experience but the initial symptoms that come from taking it kind of outweigh the positives.

Anyone else experience this with NAC? 

Edit: I just want to make it clear that these symptoms weren’t placebo because they occurred every time NAC was taken and varied in severity based on dosage. ",12,1534986754.0,Nootropics,99f6ag,4,Adverse Reaction to NAC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/99f6ag/adverse_reaction_to_nac/

Shipping notification was fast, roughly 2-3 days after submitting, but the order never made it to my place. I'm guessing it got stuck in customs. I contacted NewMind support and they told me to contact UPS. UPS then told me they handed the package over to the local postal system and I have to inquire with the vendor to get the local tracking number that was given to them, to be able to check here directly what's going on.

And yeah, that was it. I sent 3 follow up requests to NewMind asking about the tracking number but have not received a single response back. Nothing. My first request about shipping got answered on the same day (where they told me to contact UPS), the rest has not received a reply back.

I sent a last follow up a few days later on a different email and received a notification that they have merged my ticket into my previous request, but no response. This tells me that they are actually reading my message, but simply choose not to reply.

It's been almost 2 months since I ordered and am very unsatisfied with the communication. $100 isn't that cheap and the reason why I even ordered so much is so I can save on the shipping cost, but for all I know the parcel is probably lost for good by now.

If you want marked results in your life, in my opinion at least, appropriate dosage pharma-grade compounds (which can be natural, e.g. Huperzine A) are pretty much the only way to go. Some of the better supplement-type products like, say, concentrated fish oil or high-bioavailability curcumin will perhaps produce noticeable effects, but if you're ""really messed up"" don't put your faith in weak shit like that, and instead put your funds towards something much stronger. If you were just wanting to optimise your life, I could understand, but I get the impression a good chunk of people here (including myself) are in a much worse position than seeking optimisation...

"Before I get down-voted to hell because of the title, allow me to explain.

I have been using vaporized Nicotine on and off for the past year to increase my focus/productivity at work and have found it to be very effective when used in moderation. However, I've noticed on days when I use nicotine, my desire to exercise is GREATLY diminished, and I get much less of an ""endorphin rush"" after completing a strenuous workout than I normally would. I would relate the feeling of physical apathy to the psychological apathy seen in individuals who abuse cannabis (all day, every day). I still lift because I know it is good for me, and is part of my set routine, however, I get very a very diminished ""feel good"" chemical return.

Is there any documented scientific reason behind this? (i.e. dopamine receptor down-regulation, acetylcholine receptor down-regulation, etc.)

I am aware that intense exercise can be used as an effective smoking cessation aid, so I would assume, through deductive reasoning, the symptoms I describe above are experienced by others who use nicotine.

Now combine 1.6 with diet I have 2 gr of magnesium intake but I am agitated all the time. Even meditating doesnt calm me and disturbing memories races through my mind while trying to meditate.

"As an insomniac, I have a difficult time falling asleep nearly every night. This is despite having proper sleep hygiene, a solid diet, and a strenuous lifting routine. 

While I was on vacation I noticed I was able to fall asleep effortlessly after a couple G&T’s and even being able to nap easily the next day. 

Initially, of course, I believed it to be the alcohol (dry gin). However, about one week later I drank the same tonic water by itself on a whim and noticed the same exact effects. I was able to shut off my mind and fall asleep almost as soon as my head hit the pillow. Over the next few weeks I got rid of all possible confounding factors and continued to get the same results nearly every time. 

The small amount of Quinine seems to gently quiet my overly active mind in a way that allows me to get consistent, quality sleep. This very strange personal discovery has been an absolute godsend for me recently as I hate having to rely on sedatives/anxiolytics/melatonin for a good nights rest. 

I have read Quinine used to be sold as an OTC aid for night time leg cramps as well as to treat malaria. It also serves as a muscle relaxant and a possible way to augment opioids. 

I am VERY curious as to the possible MOA associated with low-dose Quinine and currently wonder how myself/others may be able to benefit from it in the future. If anyone has any answers or conjectures on how this effect occurs I would greatly appreciate it!

I am aware this effect could possibly be placebo, but I highly doubt it. 

Cheers, and thanks in advance. 

TL;DR: Low-dose Quinine from tonic water seems to have cured (or at least greatly decreased) my insomnia. 

Edit: After doing some basic math, I figured my Quinine dosage to be around 0.56mg/kg assuming the Quinine content of the tonic water is 83mg/liter (the FDA limit). 

Edit 2: Dosage was approximately 54mg (20 oz tonic water) of Quinine, 1 hour before bed time. The dosing frequency has been “as needed” (approximately 3-5 days a week).

"I have been working on enhancing my mind for years. I medicate daily, eat a strict diet, work out, and I take 10 different nootropics/supplements on a daily basis to be at my peak performance.

But EMDR therapy has been the most powerful cognitive enhancer I have ever experienced.

Basically, EMDR works by 'blurring' disturbing memories so you can process them, and once doing so these memories no longer affect your consciousness. It does this through bi-lateral stimulation, and is said to affect your eye movements mimicking REM sleep, the brains natural recovery process. Some therapists wave a wand, use a light bar, tap on your knees, or use hand vibrators or sounds. Basically, anything to cause your eyes to move from left to right, or in circles.

The department of veterans affairs considers this the go-to therapy for veterans dealing with PTSD. https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/treatment/therapy-med/emdr-for-ptsd.asp

I found this interesting and wanted to try for my PTSD and found a trained therapist and completed my therapy 100% cured of my PTSD. The traumatic event I experienced no longer affected my conscious or subconscious mind. Whenever I thought back to the memory, it seemed to become further and further away. I found myself no longer 'jumpy' or agitated. 

But then, I thought it might be something that could help increase productivity and motivation. After being in therapy I felt ready to do EMDR by myself at home using youtube vidoes (and later virtualemdr.com and emdrtool.org). By 'blurring' all of the memories of my past laziness, depression, and low self esteem, I wanted to see if I could change my thinking patterns. I have found that humans are always drawn to the negatives. I wanted to see if I could 'blur' the negatives and let the positives shine through, lifting my mood and motivation.

And it worked! 

I am more productive than ever, more motivated than ever, and I haven't had a 'down' day in months. As this went on, I found myself continually becoming happier and more productive as I became happier and more productive. I was able to build off of this and form better relationships, succeed more at work, and overcome my self esteem issues and feelings of being unmotivated.

I do not believe EMDR is placebo as I went in 100% skeptical and did not expect it to work. While some say it doesn't work for them, it works very well for many people. Here are some studies on EMDR: https://emdrtool.org/studies http://www.emdr.com/research-overview/

**How to start EMDR**

1. Find a trained therapist. You can do this through Psychology today and select 'emdr' in the side bar. Unlike regular therapy it won't cost much, as you may only need a month or so of sessions.

2. Do it yourself with tools like https://virtualemdr.com and https://emdrtool.org - At first I tried virtualemdr.com and it was great. The price was a bit high but there was some good information. I started EMDR tool just a few days ago and its free and has the same information and even the same tool. But if you need coaching virtual emdr is probably the best option

3. Use 'leg tapping' or find a youtube video. There are plenty of free youtube videos about EMDR and free EMDR tools. There are also videos that use sounds if you don't like moving dots.

But no matter how you do EMDR it is definetly worth trying. Just make sure to educate yourself on how to find target memories. But seriously, everyone should at least give it a shot.",67,1534727407.0,Nootropics,98lrev,190,Virtual EMDR Therapy Has Been My Most Powerful Nootropic.

"I live in Sri Lanka where bacopa (called lunuwila here) grows naturally. I can find them easily at the local market and it's very cheap.

# How I take it

I have it as a fresh salad when I'm having rice at dinner. 6-10g of leaves and stem per day. The old lady at the market told me to break the stems with hand and not to cut with a knife, else it would be bitter. Surprisingly it's not bitter when done like this and taken with rice. However, if you just try to eat it alone there is a distinct bitter taste.

# My previous experience with Bacopa

According to [examine.com](https://examine.com) the bacopa extract that has most scientific backing is called CDRI-8 which was developed by India. Both Keenmind and Synapsa brands use this extract and therefore these brands are the most recommended Bacopa sources. (Also  mentioned in FAQ here).

I took keenmind Bacopa for 6 months but didn't see any significant improvements in memory.  Some people say that they felt relaxed and others complain of demotivation. I  felt nothing taking it. Nothing negative. Nothing positive. And no significant memory improvements. If there were any improvements they are too minor for me to not notice. So, I stopped taking it.  It's not very well sold in my country so usually stays on shelves for months. The pack doesn't have a manufacture date and the expiry date is mentioned as 2020. So, these might very well be on shelves for years. We don't really know if they denature when left for that long specially in a tropical climate with high temperature and humidity.

That is the reason I wanted to try fresh Bacopa. After all in these regions people took fresh leaves for thousands of years.

# Current experience

I only started this week so it's too early to say anything about memory improvements. In the first few days I had some minor stomach upsets.  And also felt some relaxing effect. At least felt something compared to my previous experiences with capsules.

Assumptions I made: I assumed that lithium orotate had a 100% absorption. I assumed that lithium orotate had an elimination half life in the body of 22 hours (probably my biggest assumption). I rounded up lithium's molar mass to 7 g/mol, and I assumed that your blood levels of lithium rose with the quantity of lithium consumed at the exact moment of consumption. I assumed the human body contained 5 liters of water, and I assumed we never wanted the concentration of lithium in the blood to rise above 1mmol per liter (because that's what I read on google). 

I took the half life formula, f(x) = (initial) (.5)^(x/half life), and set that up for the numbers I had written up above, deciding to use milligrams elemental lithium cation as my unit of quantity. Since I was using mg as my unit of quantity, I wanted to calculate the maximum blood quantity of lithium I wanted to have. So, I took 1 mmol/liter, multiplied it by the 5 liters of blood I assumed a person had, and got 5mmol, multiplied it by the 7mg lithium atoms weigh per mmol, and got a max value of 35 mg that I wanted present in my body at any given time. Furthermore, I like taking 5 mg of lithium via the lithium orotate in the mornings, and 5 mg again at night. This means that I take 5 mg once at zero hours, again 8 hours after, and again 16 hours after that. So, I took my graph and added it to itself 8 hours down the x axis, and then added it to itself again 16 hours down further, and kept that going until I got 168 hours, or a week. I then set up x=h at every hour I took the pill, because this was going to be the sample points I use to make a graph in google sheets to determine the longterm trend of the blood levels. 

[Here is the desmos graph](https://i.imgur.com/39SFRIN.png)

Note I already have my trendline up here -- it's the pale blue line that extends out down the x axis in the positive direction. 

[Here is the google sheet I got the trendline from](https://i.imgur.com/nmRpHt0.png) 

You can see how my blood levels are expected to be the highest after my morning dose, since I had had my night dose just 8 hours prior. You can also see the equation of the trendline. Most importantly- the blood quantity levels off. 

Findings: for 10 mg of lithium orotate per day taken in this manner, assuming a 22 hour half life, elemental lithium blood levels do not reach above clinically-recommended levels in any short amount of time. It actually takes 341,739 hours for blood levels of lithium in this model to reach 1mmol/L in the blood -- this is about 40 years of twice daily supplementation. However, it is important to remember that in instances of kidney malfunction, the effective half life can more than double to 50 hours. In this case, my model has the individual reaching the 1mmol/L concentration in a mere 352 hours, or just over two weeks. The actual upper limit for lithium level is 1.2 mmol/L, and the actual mass of the lithium atom is 6.941 g/mol, which means that the absolute longest it may take for someone with the 50 hour half life comes out to 851 hours, or 35 and a half days. So even if someone does have kidney damage and is in the worst possible shape to be eliminating lithium from their body, it may take between two weeks and a month for their serum levels to reach above normal therapeutic dosages for lithium. For someone without kidney problems, it will take more like 40 years for these upper limits to be pushed. Of course, there was no hard data online for me to derive these half lives from, so take this all with a grain of salt.

"Greetings,


I thought I'd share my experiences about Maca root. I bought one small bag of it like 2-3 weeks ago. It's a mixture of red,yellow and black maca root. First I took 0.5g a day then tried 1 and 1.5g. For me 1g seems to be the best amount. You start to feel a bit of party going on inside your balls pretty quickly. 


So what does it do? How do I feel?
One word: ALIVE. I feel hornier, but not in a desperate way. I feel very-very confident and assertive. The anxiety is also gone. Normally I get anxious very easily and frequently, because I have anxiety disorder. I've been using phenibut and ashwagandha - both work, but they dumb me down. What maca does is a bit different in this regard - it kills anxiety, but without the dizziness in my head/sedation/drowsiness/mental slowness. Also you don't feel high on this stuff. I went to a bar then to a party a few days ago. Do you know that guy who's the most laid back, funny and confident? You know, who gets all the girls and makes everyone laugh? That was me. That can be you.


So once again the benefits: confidence, assertiveness, anti-anxiety, energy. Well it's not supposed to raise testosterone, but reading this I might aswell have been writing about that. So I inspire everyone who's looking for something with these benefits to try maca. It's amazing. 


I hope it will last long term and won't fuck my brain up. Honestly it seems too good to be true. 


Thanks for reading and let me know what you think!

"For the past 5 months or so I have been taking phenylpiracetam daily. Shortly after starting it, I added theobromine. The two had a nice synergy as phenylpiracetam seemed to improve my focus and energy and the theobromine seemed to increase my verbal abilities.

Nicotine has been an intermittent thing for me. At first I was amazed at how euphoric I felt on it. The nootropic effect was something but I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but whatever it gave me early on in the day it took away from me later in the day.

As time went on, I noticed that nicotine was making me sick, almost immediately and without even finishing the lozenge or gum, so I put it aside and would only try it occasionally, but usually with more nausea.

Seemingly unrelated to that, I was experiencing horrible muscle tension, lower back pain, muscle stiffness and aches. I had been suspecting that the phenylpiracetam and/or theobromine were causing the pain and halted use for one day. The pain seemed to lessen, but knowing that I was preparing for job interviews, I didn't want to make any changes to myself mentally because I was functioning better than normal.

Just recently, I landed that job I wanted (hold your applause) and decided to stop the phenylpiracetam and theobromine. Every day since then the pain has reduced dramatically. Today, it has been one week without them and my muscles feel almost normal again. There is some pain similar to being sore after a work out, but only in my back when I flex the muscles and some lower back pain persists. Overall, the pain is close to being gone.

So, as one final experiment, I decided to pop a nicotine lozenge today to see if it made me nauseous again. Lo and behold, no nausea.

I suppose the wonderful phenylpiracetam and theobromine experiment that I thought was improving my life was only trading muscle comfort for mental power.

On a side note, if anyone wants to quit nicotine, try some phenylpiracetam and theobromine. Nicotine will start making you sick and quitting will be easy.

I will probably try taking just phenylpiracetam by itself to see if it was that or the theobromine causing the problem.

I'm interested to see if anyone else has had a similar experience or if I am unusual in this regard (and probably others).",8,1534667888.0,Nootropics,98gd27,10,"5 Months of Phenylpiracetam and Theobromine, Side Effects and Interactions With Nicotine",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/98gd27/5_months_of_phenylpiracetam_and_theobromine_side/

"I use vinpocetine and huperzine A on a regular basis and have done for ages. Never had a problem with them. I also take some other stuff on occasion (more on this later). 

Some background for completeness and to potentially rule out/consider other things: I'd worked outside in the searing heat all day. Had nothing to eat but some toast, and while I drank water during work, it probably wasn't enough. 

Anyway I was exhausted when I got home. Had nothing on, but didn't want to waste the Friday night by going to bed early, so I decided to load up on nootropics and other stuff to perk me up and work on my French. 

I had (I think) 60mg of vinpocetine, 400mcg of huperzine (twice as much as I usually take), some ashwagandha, some fermented ginseng, choline, uridine, cordyceps, inositol. Can't remember exact dosages of that last stuff but it was all pretty much the recommended dosages on the bottles. And let's be honest here, I smoked a little weed as well! 

None of these things would ordinarily have any kind of adverse effects on me under normal circumstances. But last night, I stood up quickly and had a really violent head rush. After I recovered from that, I felt really weak and nauseous. One of those times when all you can really do is lay your head on the desk and ride it out. At some point I felt like puking and really hurled. Went back to the desk and in the next half hour had 3 more of these hurling sessions. It was quite cathartic and I really felt like my body needed to get rid of it. 

After the puking, things got pretty psychedelic. I had an unbelievably intense feeling of alertness and attention that was actually quite scary. If I closed my eyes it was all geometric patterns and pinwheels, exactly as I remember from my days of dropping acid in the 90's. Found it very difficult to get to sleep, despite taking another bit of weed for that purpose. 

So I wonder what did it? This is all stuff I've taken before, sometimes separately and sometimes together. Including with weed. The only thing I can think of is that I took too much vinpocetine, huperzine, or both. Has anyone else had vomiting and/or nausea experiences with these?

"How do you evaluate the effects of nootropics and what bias/effects would you say are most impact to try and exclude from any evaluation. I've listed some of the bias/effects of taking some nootropic, that could have an effect on your view, but would love if anyone had some other ideas and especially how to eliminate them.

1) You actually get a cognitive enhancement as a result of the drug

2) Placebo effect, you get better as a result of not the drug, but the placebo effect. Studies have shown this is very obvious, but only in the short term, so if people say: this drug stopped working for me after using it for a week! Then is probably the placebo effect stopped working after a week.

3) Very few people actually test their cognition after using nootropics and compare it to a statistical relevant baseline. It's really hard to evaluate yourself objectively.

4) You actually get a cognitive enhancement, but as a result of some other factor e.g. you slept an hour more that night, you spent more time in deep sleep, you ate better food, etc,

5) Confirmation bias: well-studied bias, which is that we hardwired to find evidence to support something we believe compared to finding new evidence that counteracts our current belief. Let's say you take some nootropic which you've read is gonna make you remember more. Then you brain when thinking back and evaluating the effect of the nootropic, you brain will look for instance where it remembered more and look less at those that counteract the effect.

6) Anchoring bias: If your friend tells you taking a specific nootropic is gonna make you study for 6 hours straight. Then you are anchoring yourself to that 6 hours, and then you try and take it maybe only study for 4 hours. In your evaluation you are thinking back and saying, arhh well I was probably studying 6 hours, because i spent a bit of time eating and, bla. bla. You make adjustments to reach the estimate and not an objective evaluation.

6) Other bias: self-serving bias, attribution bias, experimenter bias, and more.

7) You are taking a nootropic, but it's not pure and it contains something else (e.g. caffeine) that stimulates you. It clearly a possibility, but I would never buy things that wasn't tested by some third-party lab and honestly probably rare.

I highly doubt, even the most disciplined and introspective individual would be able to assess themselves objectively and I know I am not able to do that. Things I do now and/or trying to implement.

\- I use Cambridge Brain Sciences to get around (3) and more or less objectively evaluate cognitive performance.

\- I use various trackers to get around (4) including sleep tracking (Fibit and Nokia Sleep), diet tracking (myfitnesspal), overall health tracking e.g. blood pressure and temperature daily.

\- Considering getting around (2) by asking my girlfriend to administer dose (and have some placebo and some not). Afterwards look if there is a difference, but that doesn't completely remove it as she will have an experimenter bias and there's still the active placebo effect.

"I've done a whole load of research on racetams/ampa-receptor-modulators and their pharmacology and I've always come to the conclusion that there isn't any trade-off with these drugs. Every other drug that interacts with the brain always has a trade-off (mostly up/downregulation after hyperagonism/hyperantagonism of certain receptors) because of the brain's innate need to keep things balanced, aka homeostasis.

That's never the case, though! And even if they DO downregulate ampa activity, this doesn't seem to cause any noticable effects.

[Resveratrol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/resveratrol) is a natural dietary [phenolic compound](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/phenols) which is extensively present in many edible fruits, including grape, berries, pomegranates, and peanuts. Reseveratrol has a broad spectrum of biological activities including anti-aging, chemopreventive, [anti-carcinogenic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/anticarcinogen), anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and thus it is effective in related diseases. Particularly, the positive effects of resveratrol in neuropsychological diseases have been proven in in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Some clinical trials have reported that resveratrol possesses preventive and therapeutic effects in cognitive disorders. Therefore, the current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of resveratrol on cognition and memory performance as well as mood state. Electronic databases including Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane library were searched with the keywords “Memory”, “Cognitive”, “Cognition” or “Mood” with “Resveratrol” until June 2017. Only clinical studies were included in this review. We have provided the most reliable evidence to date counting results obtained from 226 individuals from four [randomized clinical trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/randomized-clinical-trial) evaluating the mentioned specific effects of resveratrol. The results of this meta-analysis showed that resveratrol has no significant effect on memory and cognitive performance assessed by auditory verbal learning tests. Two parameters of Profile of Mood States (POMS) including vigor and fatigue, decreased significantly by resveratrol. However, decrease in other parameters of POMS including tense/anxiety, depression, anger, and confusion by resveratrol was not significant.

The key findings from this meta-analysis are that resveratrol has no significant impact on factors related to memory and cognitive performance, including learning ability, delayed recall, retention, and recognition with all effect sizes non-significant and effectively at zero. However, it has the potential to enhance mood. Further [randomized, controlled trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to achieve more conclusive results.

I'm about to enter my final year of college and have access to GC/MS and HPLC-ESI/APCI testing through my school, among other things, at a very affordable cost. So I'm wondering if I could ask a bunch of the sellers for some samples of their product, and then ensure its purity by testing the samples using the lab testing equipment. I want to make good use of this resource while I'm around to use it.

I don't really know how to do it atm but I'm very willing and interested in learning by reading online about the process and then teaching myself the testing methods. Alternatively, I could get one of my bio/chem friends or the school technicians to do it for me. My main question is whether this plan is feasible and a good idea overall.

Assuming that it is, what tests do I need to do to ensure that the substance is safe to consume? I've done some reading about testing and it seems like it'd be good to do HLPC and GC/MS testing to start with. I'm thinking I might need to some sort of heavy metal testing too? Would all that be sufficient?

I know that this will be a long, involved process, and that it is of course a little risky, but I'm very passionate about biohacking and am more than ready to commit the time, money, and energy necessary if such a thing is reasonably possible.

Since starting bacopa, I've been able to pick  out songs much more easily by ear, and I've even started singing in key (a skill that has always evaded me). I doubt it's a placebo because this is the last thing I expected.

I did a little research and discovered that musical ability is associated with lower audio and visual P3 latencies (yes, both). As it happens, bacopa decreases P3 latencies. Could this be a viable mechanism of action?

"I ordered creatine monohydrate 200 mesh powder from Nootropics Depot because they were out of the more expensive ""instant powder"" version that supposedly dissolves better. I had never taken creatine before so I have nothing to compare it to. I'm not a paranoid person, but many people in the comments for the 200 mesh product were saying it is very difficult to dissolve into water and that it is coarse grain and were recommending the out of stock ""instant powder"" version. So I was expecting to have to experiment with the powder when I got it and figure out how best to take it. But the product I received mixes straight into water with hardly two twirls of a fork and is as fine as baking flour, so I'm afraid I got the wrong thing.

Is it possible they sent me the ""instant powder"" instead (even though it's out of stock and not what I ordered)?

Is it possible they sent me a completely different product? (this is really what I hope isn't the case)

The only other explanation is that a lot of people are very, very picky about their supplements, which is probably very possible.

If people need pictures, I can provide. I can also say that the taste (again, it's my first experience with creatine so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like) is extremely minimal. If I drink it in plain water it just gives the water a very, very light mineral taste like it's hard water or something. It's almost like no flavor at all.

Recently realized that one of my main issues is dopamine, everything I do to increase dopamine really helps with my ADD-Pi and motivation.

"So, I've overdosed on cytisine three year's ago (only took a little more of the solution than was recommended after feeling absolutely nothing from the recommended dose (I did my research to confirm that that dose is good for a first test back then) when I tried it the day before. I ended up vomiting every hour for a whole day with a ridiculously high heart rate, nausea (everything was spinning) and sweating) after taking about 1 and 1/3rd of the recommendation. 

I started smoking cigarettes about a year ago (half a pack a day of the 1 mg ones; red Lucky strike) and noticed that something was different than any other smoker I know. The buzz/everything spinning-effect you get from maybe your first few cigarettes has stayed so far. I can have like my 8th cigarette a day and it still puts me on my ass (kinda like it though, I actually feel more from a single cigarette than I ever felt from weed, where I'd just start hearing voices when I smoked too much).

I only recently thought about that cytisine overdose again as it just came to me while smoking one. 'I tried cigarettes before the od and didn't feel much from it, but the effects I get now remind me of that overdose.' 

Then I didn't smoke any cigarettes for two years because I didn't have the money/interest for cigarettes after the overdose and tried them again about a year ago. Today I still get effects reminiscent of that od. Only I don't get the unpleasant parts of it unless I smoke a few cigarettes back to back, where I might have to vomit from the nicotine. 

One cigarette just makes everything spin and relaxes me quite a bit. I don't get any cravings and I sometimes just go without cigarettes for a day or so without any withdrawal symptoms. Other smokers I know say that the 'tobacco flash'  happens to them as well, but theirs is much shorter in duration, lasting maybe minutes. After smoking one cigarette I get that spinning-effect and relaxation for one and a half to two hours. Then everything slowly returns to normalcy over the course of hour 2.

Also something interesting I found is that when I fall asleep day enough after having a cigarette I can get semi-lucid to lucid dreams pretty reliably, though this is irrelevant to my question.

Now my question: is it possible the cytisine overdose permanently sensitized my nAChRs somehow or could it just be my individual neurochemistry?

"Hi there guys and gals.

I have noticed in the past (and suspect it is effecting me today), that sometimes OTC stimulant products can cause some pretty big depression that is set off by environmental factors.

Has anyone ever experienced this?

Here is an example.

I started taking KSM66 ashwaganda (600-900mg a day) and felt completely AWESOME for the last two days, and then today I use an OTC stim called ""uptime"" that I get a convenience store, and a few hours later I go window shopping for a high ticket item, and i get so depressed it is scary.

I have battled depression for a while, but have had it controlled and managed for a very long time.

I recall this happening when I used alpha GPC and it SUCKED. BAD.

Currently I just take the KSM66 and noopept 30mg 2-3x a day, so nothing too exotic.

Now I felt memantine back then from the very first dose and it seems to have helped me process bad memories I was experiecing then, by somewhat deleting them and giving them no meaning. Memantine also helped me be more productive by annihilating worries and stress.

Now im starting psilocybin microdose tomorrow and I have zero intention of mixing the 2 up, but I obviously want to keep my options open (memantine) incase psilocybin doesnt live up to the expectations.

"Hello,

I've weaned myself off off lexapro because I'm suffering from a generalized anxiety disorder but didn't want to take the SSRI anymore. The last two month I had been on a very low dose of lexapro. I quit the lexapro 11 days ago. Some anxiety has come back since Wednesday. I started taking l-tryptophan the day after I took my last dose of lexapro. I take it in the afternoon and before bed but I have to be careful with the dosage. 2x500mg already seems to be too high for me. I feel a weird dizziness like my head is about to drop off of my neck (sounds weird, can't describe it better) so I take 2x200-300mg which seems to be okay. I also take magnesium and b-vitamins in the morning and melatonin before bed. I tried without melatonin because I thought with the tryptophan there would be enough to build melatonin but whenever I stop taking melatonin it takes hours to fall asleep.

Yesterday I added Ashwagandha (the one from Pure Encapsulations with 500mg per capsule and 25mg withanolides). I took it in the morning and before bed with the tryptophan and melatonin. My night was crazy. I had the scariest dream and when I woke up it was very hard to stay awake but I had to - otherwise I would've just fallen back into the exact same dream which scared the sh\*t out of me. This has happened before - when the dosage of tryptophan was too high. Maybe it was the mixture of Ash and tryptophan? Anyway. I took the Ash this morning again, felt very calm, went to the gym but when I got home I felt weird burning and tingling sensations in my body. My chest felt like it tightened. I had these sensations before when I experimented with GABA some years ago. But why this weird reaction only in the evening and not immediately after taking Ash?

"Hello dear redditors) I saw very little information on Dihexa from users,and decided to write my own report. I using Dihexa twice a week,10mg sublingual. Subjectively I feel : Slight increase in energy and emotional stability. Significant boost to creativity and social insight(Wich I really lack since I am diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome) It also greatly enhances cognitive flexibility (to degree that I can even change some of my daily routines in accordance to circumstances). But that rumors saying that Dihexa itself can cause autistic-like conditions is definitely true from my experience,it made me slightly more autistic than I was before,but I don't care about this as dihexa actually not only increased some symptoms ,but modified behavior to more appropriate,thus relieving part of symptoms. Sorry for my sometimes bad English,it is not my native language. Would be glad to see your experiences and thoughts on this.

UPD. What I call the worsening of symptoms is the increase of daily routine dependency and increase in face agnosia. What i call behaviour modification to more appropriate is the increase in ability to infer explicit social rules, and since that my social fluency is increased. And yes, i am officialy diagnosed with  Aspergers when i was 10 years old.

"I've been taking ALCAR for about a year. At around 2,000mg/day.

This past week I recently quit vaping nicotine and bought some Alpha GPC and NAC just in case the withdrawals were significant. The withdrawals were virtually non existent. 2 days post-nicotine and I felt pretty good, maybe a little restless, but nothing difficult.

My curiosity got the best of me and I decided to try out some Alpha GPC pre-workout. The first day I took 300mg and skipped the ALCAR for the rest of the day. Day one was all good. Second day I took 300mg and noticed I felt very good, social, and surprisingly sharp. The third day I took Alpha GPC pre-workout WITH my usual ALCAR dosage. And then took another 300 mg dose post workout with ALCAR. And cue.. mayhem. 

That was the last dosage I took of both ALCAR and Alpha GPC. That night it began with a tense jaw and a bit of extra energy. Which quickly transferred to a clenched jaw and the inability to sit still or lay down. I barely slept and woke up the next day with even stronger symptoms. Tight jaw clenching, my brain feels like its on fire, tons of energy, poor concentration, everything is a million mph. This has lasted for 3 days. Today marks the 3rd day since my last dose. Jaw is still clenched, brain still feels like its on fire. Maybe a 20% reduction in intensity since the first day.

Questions:

What did I do wrong? Is there any way I can re-visit this combination down the road to make it advantageous? The physical energy has been amazing, workouts feel great, stamina and strength are high. But its too intense.

When will this stop? I can barely focus. I feel a bit dumber, and that words are harder to recall. I haven't been able to get any mental work done. If this doesn't subside within a few more days I will be very worried. I tried to take benadryl (anticholinergic) but felt no relief.

How much damage is being done? How bad is this state for my brain? The tight jaw, racing thoughts, lack of sleep, inability to concentrate.

Any suggestions for helping me get back to baseline? I've ordered Piracetam (never taken it before) and will use it if symptoms persist. I feel like now is a pretty good time to take a break from all nootropics but I'm pretty far from my baseline.

"Hello, so i've been a lurker here for a bit, I was recently reading about the brains goal/reward system with serotonin and dopamine and how the modern human is deprived of both by basically being indoors throughout most of the day for serotonin and doing addicting stuff with electronics and substances for dopamine (internet use, games, porn)..

I've been reading alot of studies how both are a kind of nootropic and basic motivator and impulse control in various studies, alot of  them recommend to get sunlight to replenish serotonin but my question is for any person who knows more or read more studies is what dose of light, how many hours should you be outside daily etc? anyone know?",48,1533948846.0,Nootropics,968oeg,95,Serotonin and sunlight,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/968oeg/serotonin_and_sunlight/
"I  have been taking anywhere from 500-800mg of Uridine (UMP), 400-500 (50%  Alpha GPC), and 2-3 grams of Omega 3 fatty acids a day. I started this  stack 3 days ago and I have had noticeable improvements in my fatigue,  happiness, hyperactive (fidgeting), concentration, anhedonia, and many  other related problems.

I have noticed I  am more willing to do things where before I felt a huge fatigue, apathy,  and struggle to even start. I would not say I feel energetic or  motivated but nonetheless I do not have an overbearing mental block  preventing me from doing anything productive. Fidgeting is waaaaayyyyyy  down. I would say only about 20-30% of what it was before starting. I am  also more patient and less scatter brained when on task and  conversation. I would not say I am happy yet but at least I am not  constantly and overbearingly negative anymore. I actually notice after a  half hour to an hour after taking the dose I see the world as more  vibrant, the colors and the essence of nature. Whereas before it was  almost cloudy, dull and grey.

So overall,  I have noticed a positive benefit but not enough where I would say I am  normalized to baseline...yet. I have multiple, multiple compounding  genetic issues which effect my neurotransmitters (most noticeably  dopamine, its receptor concentration and overall level). Although  speculative, I also believe I had long term negative effects from hits  to the head when I was a developing pre-teen and teenager. A metal  baseball bat to the bare head, frequently hitting my head on walls and  other hard surfaces, and multiple head to head impacts from football  which left me seeing black a few seconds afterwards. Also, I have a very  small cranium size as I was told by a doctor at 6 months I was a  microencephalic. Verified even as an adult where I come significantly  below the lower 3rd percentile for adult male head circumference size  per my height. So these factors compound negatively for my brain health.

Overall,  if I had to put a number on my initial mental health before starting  this stack it would be 4 on a scale of 1-10 (10 being optimal) and now I  would say I am a 6 on the scale of well being. Much better than  anything else I have done before other than substances that temporarily  help like adderall increasing dopamine. I believe the uridine, omega 3s  and alpha gpc will have long term benefits even after I stop dosing.

Edit/Add: I gave a similar but lower dose to my cousin who responded so much better to one administration. Gives me more evidence to me that my neurotransmitters and density are really messed up.",14,1533947315.0,Nootropics,968gad,2,"Uridine Monophosphate, Alpha-GPC, and Omega 3s: Help with ADHD and Depression",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/968gad/uridine_monophosphate_alphagpc_and_omega_3s_help/

"I know this might be a highly individualized response -- but, I've had great success with high quality loose-leaf green tea as a nootropic. I've found it to be the most uplifting and nearly miraculous nootropic I've experienced, surpassing the effect of modafinil and other stimulants.  It surpassed the effect of coffee, caffeine alone or other caffeinated (black) tea. I presume it had to do with EGCG's ability to act as a COMT-I and upregulate dopamine. That, plus the natural inclusion of l-theanine and theobromine seemed to have an effect on me that was rather profound. I'm not sure I'll ever know which compound was so effective for me, since none seem to work in isolation.

I decided to use it every morning as part of my routine, the same way many use coffee.

My brewing technique produced a very strong extraction. I'd use 1 tablespoon (normal serving is teaspoon, but the label for my brand said tablespoon explicitly) and brew it for 10 minutes.   On some days, I might have up to 3 cups this strong.

The problem: I rapidly developed an allergy. Over time, my face began to turn red in a rosacea-like pattern. After a year or two of blaming everything else I could, not wanting to give up my morning pick-me-up, the reaction progressed to tingling and pustules.  As soon as tea intake stopped (actually, about 36 hours later) so did the facial flushing and tingling.

"Hey guys I’ve found some benefit and figured you’d all enjoy this.

I ordered two noopept nasal spray units from nootropicsource.com because centropic closed and didn’t see any other reputable vendors carrying what I wanted. 

Before this experiment I hadn’t tried the nasal route for noopept in a reliable way,  each vial is 10ml with 150mg of noopept dissolved and a spray volume of ~0.1ml/spray which equals to 1.5mg noopept per spray.  I paid in ethereum and the order arrived within two weeks.

I’ve tried the oral route for noopept with limited success, I use the spray twice a day, first in the morning and second in the afternoon (just one spray each time).

The product came packaged well, the noopept was not fully dissolved in the liquid and appears to reconstitute into solid form when left for a while, although a little bit of shaking when I first got them had most of the noopept dissolved.  The bottles are glass and feel of quality. The sprays don’t have the classic “chemical war in your mouth” noopept taste, although there is a very mild noopept taste in the mouth if I spray too many times and it drips down.

So far I’ve noticed more benefit from this ROA vs. Oral as I can control the dosage perfectly.  Mild memory improvements and a noticeable boost to my multitasking but I wasn’t expecting a magic pill experience so all in all I’m very satisfied with the product.  (I have also noted a reduction in the presence of eye floaters and sky sprites although that may not be the noopept itself as I have been much healthier in my lifestyle lately overall)

Anyways, I would recommend anyone interested in noopept to make a nasal spray system yourself or purchase one because I feel it’s much better this way to administer.

From what little research I have done, it seems that creating art has positive effects on the functionality of the brain:

However I have not seen much online in terms of art students taking or using nootropics to increase brain function for learning purposes. 
Ideally I would like to find out if there can be a positive effect on the learning process (specifically for visual art) by taking a form of Nootropics, however I am unsure as to what specifically would best apply for visual art. 

The learning process for visual art revolves around technique and application, so from what the stickied thread tells me is that L-Theanine and caffeine would help for focus and productivity when learning, but is there a better, more specific nootropic to enhance visual and technical learning? Ideally the things I would like to improve are my ability to learn and retain information, and be able to put it into practice in order to slightly speed up the learning process.

"Most of what I learnt about the quality of various mushroom extracts has been from things posted on this sub, which we all know is a bit of an echo chamber. I naively believed that whole fruiting bodies extracts are superior to mycelium on grain extracts, and assumed that Paul Stamets was pretty silent about why he uses supposedly inferior methods for making these supplements, but then I stumbled across the following blog on his website which brings up the issue:

[https://fungi.com/blogs/articles/benefits-of-mycelium](https://fungi.com/blogs/articles/benefits-of-mycelium)

""Testing verified both the mycelium and the cultured rice substrate as immunologically active.\* Furthermore, the mycelium and the cultured rice substrate are active in different ways, each conferring unique and complimentary immune benefits.\*""

""Some vendors in the mushroom supplement space deceptively argue that mycelium grown on a grain substrate is not useful for consumers and that only mushroom fruitbodies are valuable in supporting health. These claims contradict hundreds of articles published in the scientific literature demonstrating the health-enhancing value of mushroom mycelium grown on grain substrates such as organic brown rice, including a NIH funded study confirming the immunologically supporting activity of Host Defense Turkey Tail mycelium capsules.\*

Paul Stamets notes, “In my scientific opinion, mushroom products not incorporating mycelium are at a decided disadvantage, given the results of recent research.”""

I'm not saying the above is sufficient to drop the prejudice against his products, but I just find it super hard to believe that such an expert with so much passion for mushrooms could knowingly sell a poor quality product.

"I always required about 10 hours of sleep. Sleeping less during the workweek created a cumulatively increasing sleep debt; Friday was a constant battle to not fall asleep. On weekends I was sleeping up to 15 hours repaying the sleep debt. Pretty shitty arrangement.

After years of trying, I finally found something that allows me to sustainably sleep less. Every morning I take:

250mg nicotinamide riboside

"I've been looking into how to store powers very long-term(over a decade). And I've come away with a lot of consistency, and some contradiction. I'll list the consistencies and ask for clarification on the contradictions:

Consistent needs:

1. Desiccant/Moisture/Drying packets(preferably half-gram in size)
2. Heat sealed mylar bags
3. Oxygen absorbing packets
4. Vacuum sealed bags
5. Styrofoam box/Igloo cooler

The way you prepare it is placing the powder in a mylar bag, and adding a desiccant packet(preferably a tyvek style silica packet). An oxygen absorbing packet is also added(most spoilage bacteria requires oxygen to live). Then the mylar bag is heat sealed. Several mylar bags are prepared in this way and then all of them are placed inside of a vacuum sealed bag. Another silica packet and oxygen packet are added to the vacuum sealed bag. The bag is then sealed. The sealed vacuum bag is placed into a styrofoam box to prevent bugs and light from reaching it, while also partially reducing moisture exposure. An igloo cooler can also be used, but is less effect for both bugs and moisture.

So that's all of the prep I plan to do - but there are a couple of problems in Step #1. Namely, there is massive disagreement on whether to actually put the desiccant silica and oxygen absorbing packs directly into the powder or not. 

One group says to put the powder in a light plastic jewelry style bag with nothing in it and press the powder to the very bottom and seal that pack off, and place it in a mylar bag that has the desiccant and oxygen absorbing packs. They say that the powder directly being exposed to the desiccant and oxygen absorbing packs will turn the powder into a brick over a decade's time.

The other group which says to stick the desiccant and oxygen absorber directly into the powder, says that in order to ensure bacteria doesn't grow, you have to do it this way. They literally don't even talk about the brick issue. They don't say it doesn't happen. They don't say it does. They don't even mention it at all.

I know some things like salt and sugar absolutely cannot be directly exposed to desiccant packs. They do in fact turn into bricks. But I don't know how true this is for nootropic powders. I would think most of the salts and heavier grains probably can't be added directly. But I really don't know what the bacterial risk is. Ultimately a brick is difficult to work with, but probably still usable, while bacteria infested powder would just have to be discarded.

I'd rather not unseal my packs in 2035 to discover a brick of a banned substance that no longer exists - and I'd equally prefer not to open up a pack of mold. None of this stuff is relevant for 2-3 year storage, but it's highly relevant for 10+ year storage. Do you have any thoughts on which way is better in general?

I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/94gl2u/negative_side_effects_from_low_dosage_of_an/e3mep6f/) today on /r/DrugNerds today and it makes perfect sense so I wanted to share. That's all.

> The 'sensitization from low doses of amphetamines' thing is actually a reddit myth perpetuated by a few people (such as /u/superagonist
> , sorry for the callout but I have to tell it like it is) who have severely misinterpreted the studied. Almost every single claim made about it is completely false.
> 
> First, not a single one of the studies linked by these people actually uses a ""micro-dose"". Most of them would be the equivalent to starter doses for ADHD. Here I'm unsure if super agonist does not understand the meaning of mg/kg, and that you have to multiply it by the overall weigh of the user. The study with the LOWEST dose of amphetamine he has linked is 0.4mg/kg. For me, a 68kg male, that would be over 25mg amph - actually higher than the therapeutic starting dose. There has never been a study on a 'micro-dose' on a stimulant, and why would there be? Scientists understand that it would just be the same effect except too small to study.
> 
> Biologically it makes no sense for low doses of stimulants to have such a bad effect. The body has endogenous stimulants (such as phenylethylamine) active all the time, sometimes at low doses, sometimes at higher doses. Stimulants are only adding to the natural release of dopamine. Nothing we know about the mechanism of action of dexamph would suggest anything like what this story does, and no scientist studying this has ever posed this as a theory. Frankly, as a general rule, I'd imagine that it would be better to trust the scientists who dedicated their lives to studying the chemical before the reddit sleuths (no offense to the reddit sleuths here, myself included).
> 
> Second, sensitization to the dopaminergic effects of amphetamines (and 'behavioral sensitization', which in animal model means enhancement of certain behavioral responses to stimulants, but not others) is indeed readily identified in animal models in the literature. There's just one problem as far as this theory is concerned: it is identified at many doses of stimulants in all kinds of stimulants. Here they identified dopamine sensitization from repeated high doses of cocaine. Here's one using a high dose of amph (and yes, 10mg/kg is a high dose, the equivalent of over 500 milligrams in a regular-sized human). And they've even found that sugar dependency and stress can induce a behavioral sensitization-like effect, which makes sense because the body releases those endogenous stimulants in response to stimulation. (However, it is not LOW amounts of stress but HIGH amounts of stress that is more likely to cause this).
> 
> The studies suggest that the effect of dose on dopamine-induced sensitization is the opposite of what this nebulous theory claims: high (non-neurotoxic) doses are actually far more likely to cause behavioral sensitization than low doses. That Laviola study I linked showed sensitization occured far more readily from 10mg/kg than 2mg/kg. Further, like most drug-induced plasticity it appears to be dependent on the length of use, such that one use doesn't cause it.
> 
> In other words, with stimulants as with almost anything else, the overwhelming body of evidence suggests that low doses of amphetamines are safer when it comes to the avoiding long-term effects. Color me shocked.
> 
> Those who think high doses of dopaminergic drugs are supposed to cause downregulation and not upregulation might be confused by this result. (Perhaps this is where superagonist's confusion began too?) Basically, such a view is far too simplistic. This article lays out many of the theories for why behavioral sensitization occurs, from a downregulation of pre-synaptic neurons (which actually regulate the release of dopamine, such that a downregulation increases dopaminergic activity) to an increase in the readily-releasable pool of dopamine. Though that article is old, a peruse at a more recent but less comprehensive articles suggest they still don't really know 100%. What they do know now is the involvement of glutamate: the use of NMDA receptor antagonists blocked the development of behavioral sensitization. Further, it is associated with increased expression of AMPA receptors.
> 
> Lastly, as for those testimonials, do some critical thinking: many are from extreme recreational drug users that were on many different chemicals at the time. Of course some of those chemicals could potentate the amphetamine, or synergize with it for nasty effects. Regular high-dose stimulant use (which many of the testimonial writers use) also makes the user more likely to have paranoia and delusions -- such as perhaps the delusion that they were permanently scarred by one dose of a drug based on an internet scare-story. Remember too that one can even more readily find testimonials about alien abduction.
> 
> As for the safety of low-doses of benzedex: I'd suggest your best source for that would be long-term trials mandated by the FDA on drugs like that. Read the studies: was it generally well-tolerated? Did the users have to go off because of mounting side effects? What you will find is that despite some side effects fairly low doses of stimulants do not usually induce those ""nasty effects"" like persistent insomnia, etc. I would suggest that low doses would be fine occasionally (probably not all the time, though), and certainly safer than high doses.",23,1533461585.0,Nootropics,94o8ry,61,The truth (myth) about dopamine sensitization from low dose stimulants,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/94o8ry/the_truth_myth_about_dopamine_sensitization_from/

"**TL;DR:** I stupidly overdosed on Vitamin D (20,000IU/day for 2 months) in 2017, and developed leg numbness, bone/muscle pain, and severe anxiety. This was despite taking it with high doses of Magnesium Citrate (400mg/day) and Vitamin K (K1+K2-MK4+K2-MK-7, all types). My Vitamin D levels have been normal already 2.5 months after ceasing intake, and so have my calcium levels (8.9mg/dL). It has been 1 year since stopping Vitamin D intake and my symptoms have only slightly improved. Is it permanent? Did anyone else have a similar experience?

****

I, quite stupidly, took very high doses of Vitamin D3 (20,000 IU/day) for a total of 2 months in 2017. I ceased all Vitamin D3 intake in August 2017, and 2.5 months later, a blood test has shown my 25(OH)D being 29ng/ml, and my calcium levels have also been normal (8.9mg/dl). I always took these high doses with Magnesium Citrate (400mg/day) and a Vitamin K complex (1500mcg K1, 1000mcg K2-MK4, 200mcg K2-MK7), although I have used 10,000 IU daily for a long time beforehand without any Vitamin K.

My main symptoms from Vitamin D toxicity were:

* Leg numbness - my legs, at times, would feel almost entirely numb.

* Serious back pain, so serious that combined with my leg numbness, I thought some disc herniated a nerve in my back, so I went to the ER 4 times in a month, got an MRI, but everything looked fine - no herniations

* Random pain at random areas in my body, and exaggerated pain after very minor blunt trauma

* Severe anxiety and daily panic attacks - I always had generalized anxiety, OCD and social anxiety before, but I began having daily panic attacks and strong flight reflexes for hours and hours every single day. It is as if my body is in a constant state of perceiving danger and telling me to run away / hide.


During the last months of 2017 (August-December), after stopping the Vitamin D3, I kept taking the Magnesium Citrate and Vitamin K complex in order to make sure any sort of possible calcification in my body from the Vitamin D3, would clear up. I took them for about 3 months after cessation of the Vitamin D, then only took them intermittently since. In May 2018, 3 months ago, I went back on the Vitamin D3 (at 1000 IU/day), because I thought there is no possible way my symptoms are still from the Vitamin D overdose - it has been 9 months until May. I took the 1000 IU daily for a month, felt even worse, then stopped in mid June.

Currently, I'm on a break from all supplements and all drugs (including my prescribed Adderall, and even caffeine). I have not taken any supplement or any drug for the past 10-11 days, yet my severe anxiety and leg numbness show no signs of improvement, at all. 

What's weird to me about this thing is that my calcium levels are normal (8.9mg/dL as of November 2017, 9mg/dL as of June 2018, 2 months ago). These levels are on the low range of normal. Anxiety from overdoses of Vitamin D almost always stems from hypercalcemia - having too much calcium in the blood. My calcium level is not even close to being high, so how can this be I'm still suffering most of the symptoms? Is it possible that I still have vascular calcification in my body (even after a year), and that's what causing the anxiety and leg numbness?

Did anyone else here have a similar experience?

"Hey guys, I started to use L-tyrosine searching for a solution for my low motivation and energy to do things. I do therapy for 2 years, I try to have motivation, discipline.. tried a lot of things, started to exercise, to do todo-lists, but I always begin but can't finish. I start to study, then 15 min later I'm on gaming or pornography.

I started to take on Saturday morning (500mg) along 5-HTP (50mg) night, spend the weekend with my GF, so I didn't tried to do something boring with requires motivation. On 3rd day Monday morning [I felt ""trippy"" with 5-HTP](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/93fw30) then I stopped to use 5-HTP and I used only L-tyrosine. I had to go to the bank, do boring stuff, my bed broke and I fixed, I did a lot of things, I wouldn't say it was amazingly much more productive than those days that I try to be productive, but it helped in a way.

3rd and 4th nights was harder than usual to sleep, lot of thoughts in my head, kind of anxious, and I woke up in the middle of night without any sleepiness and anxious. I never was this anxious before, so I stopped to use for a day.

The 5th  day (without L-tyrosine) wasn't productive, however I came back to normal, didn't felt anxious and I had a great sleep again!

6th day (today) I took again, and woow, I felt the euphoria, the energy.. I did a lot of stuff.. go shop food, study,  very productive!

Honestly I don't know how much of this is placebo, but the euphoria after take it and the bad sleep and anxiety at night was real! And the fact that I did a lot of stuff that I wouldn't do in a whole week just in a day make me feel very glad! But honestly it doesn't work alone, I still have to struggle to start a task and I still have triggers to make me to abort.. however **now I have a plus energy..it's easier to start a task or continue doing the task when I think to stop** (and then do something fun like games or YouTube). I still need discipline, since I also played games, however in a ""normal day"" I would do that the whole day, now I play a bit and say to myself ""I need to study"".. then I have the energy to go and to not abort!

I must confess that I got a lot of **euphoria** on the first 4 hours after take it, and **tension on neck and while breathing along high heartbeat, and the anxiety at night** and I don't know how much that worth really. Seems a 20% plus more energy and motivation for 80% more negative side effects, maybe that's the reason to take along 5-HTP but honestly I got scare due ""trippy"" and panic effect that I had.

I believe it is accurate as I supplement with phenibut have a COMT mutation and less D2 receptors and take lithium for my bipolar which would raise serotonin levels as well as taking an NSAID which would lower cytokines which block the conversion of tryptophan into 5htp then serotonin instead it concerts to quinolinic acid in high amounts but my NSAID supplementation would optimise serotonin production therefore.

To me this looks like I  have perfected my supplementation but does any of my levels look worrying to you ? 

Without phenibut my gaba would be very low and without lithium my dopamine would be very high and without an NSAID lithium multivitamin probiotic fish oil vitamin D TMG my serotonin would be low.

"*skip to the last paragraph if you just want to answer the question and not read my story*

I've been a serious coffee drinker since I was 17 (I'm now 22) consuming about 3-4 cups of strong instant coffee every day for all those years (my maximum is 7 cups but this happens rarely). I've been cycling the dosage from time to time to keep it working but I would never go caffeine free for more than 4 days in a row this whole time so I have a fucked up tolerance.

Looking back at the last couple of years, I noticed that I have become somewhat depressed and very fucking anxious (almost always paranoia type of anxiety, like being absolutely afraid to do BARELY illegal shit like smoke a joint with my friends in fear of the police/parents finding out and the likes).
I also cycle through periods of apathy/complete lack of motivation and periods when I feel I can conquer the fucking world (not literally).

Last week I noticed that I could actually sleep even if I had just consumed a couple of cups back to back without being otherwise tired so I just said fuck it, coffee is probably causing all these problems and I need to quit.

"Hello all! I'm working on  a crude flavonoid extraction procedure on some dried Scutellaria lateriflora leaf. I have limited access to solvents while I'm back East visiting family, and this plant is not widely used it seems, despite its promising properties (well, baical skullcap is more promising, but like I said, limited resources). So really there's not much info out there. Do any of you nooice people have any experience with this, or other flavones in general?

I ground it up in a blender with some water and just tossed it in the freezer to lyse the cell walls. I plan on boiling it with some lemon juice in order to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds in order to convert everything to the most active components. I will then dry it either on a low heat in the oven or in the air, depending on humidity. After this, I have a few options.

1). add boiling 200proof ethanol (and keep hot) and then strain while hot (i have a very limited supply of this)

2). use dry acetone to try to pull out anything I can (i only have industrial grade acetone on hand)

3). use hot isopropyl alcohol with small amounts of tocopherol acetate added in hopes of boosting the solubility of the flavonoids

4). set up a crude subcritical/near-supercritical co2 extractor with some plastic centrifuge tubes i have lying around (i've gotten this to work once before but I'm not sure that my centrifuge tube has enough surface area for its diameter)

5). butane? anyone know apigenin solubility in liquid butane off the top of their heads?

"Hi,

I was recently (finally) diagnosed with ADHD and I've been having great success with Concerta. My anxiety vanished, I was calm, focused and I was finally able to focus on myself and manage to finish even the most basics of things, like go out, see friends, study. What was strange tho is that my medicine is suppose to work around 8-12ish hours, and for me I start to get the come-down around 3-4h mark. My doctor said that the medicine works differently for different persons, which fine, I understand, but 3-4h is not enough for me. I am on my first year of study for to become a Construction Engineering, and I really need more time since the sluggish side effects of the Concerta renders my brain useless. I scour the interwebs and find a post on reddit with a list of Nootropics and other supplements that works well with stimulants. My interest peaked when I read about Tums.

Since 5 years back I've had gastric issues which has coinsded with a permanent brain fog, and I've gone great length to try to understand what was wrong. Tried Low histamine foods, tried eating low GI, excluded everthing that could upset my stomach. Much without success, so I went to the doctor and he got some blood and all the results were fine. I tho never give up, so I started WebMDing and found out that my issues could be linked to my stomach being to acidic.

I tried Baking soda and saw that not only did it help my stomach, but it potentiate my Concerta, it also made it last longer. Not by much, but longer. I suspect my gastric issues + ADHD has been the culprit for my anxieties and my constant thick foggy and heavy head.

I'm now trying to find a stack that'll play well with my Concerta to help me with my studies.

This is my current nootropic stack that's working ""fine"":

**Morning:**

Baking soda

ALA

ALCar

L-Tyrosine

Rhosidola Rosea

Vitamin B- complex

**Lunch:**

Magnesium

Vitamin d2+k2

CoQ10

Creatine

**When the comedown of Concerta:**

ALA

ALCar

L-Tyrosine

**With dinner:**

Magnesium

Vitamin C

Vitamin E

Betacarotene

**Hour before bed:**

Taurine

Turmeric

Omega 3

**Some thoughts and questions:**

I've tried **GDP-Choline** and **Choline bitrate** and they keep giving me brain fog and or headache. Since I live in Sweden I don't have access to ractrams which is a travesty.

**L-Tyrosine:**

Works pretty much how I've read it should, when my come-down starts it more or less medigate and I feel fine.

**L-Theanine:**

Felt like it ruined the effects of Concerta. I wasn't calm, I didn't focus as well but my heart beat was good.

**Taurine:**

Makes me feel warm, focused but still slightly tierd, not foggy tierd, but good tierd.

My question is, am I overdoing? I do feel that some of these are good in combination with my daily Concerta use, since I've felt a build up of tolerance towards my medication. And also could the ""tolerance"" be because of my medication depleting my Dopamin? Since the L-tyrosine I take after the comedown helps immensly. I'd like to have a stack that helps me keep my body healthy and helps my cognitive abilites and focus.

"I noticed that whenever I combine Adderall and Magnesium (both Citrate and Malate), the effects of the Adderall completely change.

Adderall, a dopamine-notepinephrine releasing agent, is supposed to feel different then Ritalin, a dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. This was also the case in my experience - they do feel much different. Adderall usually feels better, as it is less likely to make me irritable, rigid, physically uncomfortable, ""robot""-like, or socially withdrawn, compared to Ritalin.

However, when I combine Adderall and Magnesium, it feels almost exactly the same as Ritalin - I get highly irritable, socially withdrawn and physically uncomfortable.

Wellllll, ITPP is a whole other ballgame....Ive found it to have some of the best acute affects of all the noots I've taken.

No, it's not directly  psychoactive in a druggy sense... neither is it stimulatory. However, it did wonders for my spatial awareness and focus, as well as boosted my stamina  ;).

"The easy answer is to stop taking it, however I only 'suspect' it is the ash. I have gone through a lot of ""changes"" the past 3 weeks. Coincidentally, I so happened to start taking ashwagandha around 3 weeks ago. I understand that my anxiety can be from the ashwagandha, or it can be from stress from changes. Some changes that have undergone in past 3 weeks: Stressing in finding a new job, current job has dramatically cut my hours so im less productive than id like to be, this 'idle time' is snowballing into lots of negative thoughts that i havent really had in a long time. Also around 3 weeks ago, I made a diet change as I had lost 30 pounds and have reached my goal weight, I have increased my daily calorie intake by almost 1000 calories to ""maintain"". This means I am no longer eating as clean as I was before in order to hit my calories/per day. 

Im not sure if its also the ashwagandha that is causing it either.. maybe had i not taken the ash, I would be coping with these changes 10x better. 

Anyways my main question is---------

Can I simply stop taking ashwagandha and notice a difference the next day? Or does it take a few days-weeks for the ashwagandha to get out of my system so i can decide then if its contributing to my anxiety?

P.S. Since i made so many changes at once, its going to be hard to dial down on the main culprit. But ashwagandha is my #1 suspect, next i will go back to my old diet just to test it out, and then im working on my work situation so that can be fixed very soon as well.

I didn't feel anything different until my 4th day, I started in the morning doing some silly mistakes that I don't usually do, and minutes later talking with my GF on breakfast I realized that I was very strange, I wasn't very aware about what she was talking about and the perception of things around me was different than usual and my emotions was 'plastic',  I wasn't comfortable at my own home, I panicked about this strange feeling and went outside to take a breath and I realized that I was indeed strange like lightheaded.

I thought it was very secure, since people take this only for appetite, sleep better, and I was taking the 'minimum dosage' and I never read any report about this side effect. Strange because even on ""harder"" drugs such SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc..) there is no report like this.

It's very difficult to articulate this bizarre emotion, but it felt as e**verything was standing distrubingly still or the present moment felt like past.** This is at least how I would describe this, even though everything was occuring on the emotional level, not like **I was going mad or losing contact with realit**y. Overall I didn't find this very comfortable.

>I started taking 5-Htp for depression and stess.(...) After day 2 I started to experience light h**eadedness, headache,dizziness, brain fog**, muscle weakness/pain/numbness, vivid dreams and waking nightmares, muscle twitching, chills, chest pain (...) so I lowered my dose after a few days to 50mg per day at lunch. The vivid dreams went away along with the muscle twitching and chest pain. But the other problems still persist (...) Im surprised by how little side effects are mentioned by others, so I needed to share my experience. Way too many serious side effects!

>I started the L-tyro a few days after starting 5-htp. I only added this because I read someplace that **5-htp isn't 'selective' about which serotonin receptors it targets - unlike SSRI's - and some receptors are a bit trippy**. **L-tyro counteracts these trippy effects.** I don't know if that is scientifically correct but I did occasionally feel something akin to **lightheaded** in a way that affected my **spatial awareness**, so I bought the L-tyrosine to see if it made this stop happening - yep, it worked. And it added it's own joys to the mix as well.

"Hi all,

I suffer from Vestibular Migraine - which basically makes me dizzy, uncoordinated, brain-foggy, fatigued and feels like my brain is overloaded by sensory information.

It is believed to be caused by glutamate excitoxcity in the brain, which then knocks a load of calcium out of the cells, essentially causing a nasty shitstorm in the brain.

I started to take NAC (600mg per day), mainly in order to boost gluthione as I have a damaged pancreas and believe I have problems converting glutamate to GABA (taking GABA precursors alone did not help me.)

After a few weeks, my dizziness and balance problems practically disappeared. I have been far less fatigued, more motivated, have more verbal fluency and have been able to do things that usually trigger worsening of symptoms without being triggered. I had the best few weeks ever with massively reduced symptoms in over 4 years of this illness, where nothing else had worked. Prior to this, I had symptoms every day.

I am a recovering alcoholic, too. I also started taking Sunlower Lecithin 2.4mg per day a while back, as it is recommended to make recovering alkies feel normal, reduce cravings and feel at ease - and it sure does.

I am also taking other vitamins and minerals and have been for ages without much positive effect.

But in the last couple of weeks, I have noticed, I am quickly developing a spare tyre round my stomach (I'm female by the way), and my short-term memory is completely shot. I had memory problems before (as part of Vestibular Migraine), but not to this quite scary degree. I'm not eating more and I don't think it's due to my vits/minerals as I've been taking thmm for ages. I don't understand as both NAC and Lecithin have been shown to help people lose wight if anything and improve cognition.

Then yesterday, it seemed the NAC stopped working - I tried having another dose, but the sensory overload did not diminish, and I had to take a diazepam (the only thing that truly halts a vestibular migraine).  

This morning it appears that my spare tyre has lessened (despite me taking more NAC than usual yesterday to try and block the migraine although that did't work).

Could NAC or Lecithin (or the combo) be causing a WORSE memory and fat accumulation round my belly?

I don't want to stop taking either of them as I have had such positive results generally. But the memory issue is really scaring me and I really don't like my balloning stomach.

If it is one or the other, or both, would I be better off taking other things that make up the products? (ie. sunflower lecithin is comprised of phoshatdyl-choline, -serine and -inostiol as well as fatty acids) Would I be better off just taking Inositol and Phosphatydlserine? What about the NAC? Why could it have stopped working and could it be contributing to my problems more than the Lecithin (I know its the one thing that has up until now helped my balance and other symptoms enormously, but it has only been after adding it that my memory has turned into that of a goldfish.

Excuse me for spellos (not taken anything today until I get some more advice).

"*TLDR: the default mode network is very likely responsible for the ego and sense of self, as well as problem solving skills etc.. What are some DMN deactivators other than LSD?*

I just read [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26362774) about THCv and how it reduces activation of the DMN. Now, THC increases DMN activation - I also notice the effects of this when I'm high (especially on high THC strains, I hate them).

There are many deeply ingrained parts of my personality that I dislike. I would say, among other things, this is mainly due to my mother's personality and the effect it had on me, and how she raised me. As of over a year ago, I've been putting a LOT of effort into changing these parts of me (it's very difficult) for example by thinking hard about how I reacted to whatever, why I reacted to whatever, and what I should try to do instead in whatever given case, etc..

Anyway, how this is relevant to the Default Mode Network is the following: One way weed's effects on the DMN present is how my personality becomes far less malleable, less thought-out, less developed. Weed has negative effects on my ego - it definitely does not feel like it dissolves the ego at all. That is to say for example, my reactions, namely negative ones, are *even more* reflexive than normal and therefore harder to control. I dislike this intensely. I've said multiple times to my girlfriend that ""I become an asshole when I'm high."" **This definitely now makes sense (having only recently figured this out, as in shortly before making this post), since the Default Mode Network** ***""seems to be the best candidate that we have for the biological underpinnings of the sense of self (ego),""*** **as Robin Carhart-Harris, a researcher with Imperial College’s Center for Neuropsychopharmacology,** [**put it**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lsd-may-chip-away-at-the-brain-s-sense-of-self-network)**.**

LSD reduces DMN activation significantly which is one of the reasons it affects us the way it does. LSD is a known ego-dissolving substance (ego death being common above 300mcg). My girlfriend and I recently dropped quality 150mcg tabs for the first time. **Without ANY conscious effort or intervention, I found that parts of my personality that I disliked were stripped away, which was a very welcomed surprise.** I wasn't expecting it at all, and it just happened so naturally. During the trip I didn't even think about my personality at all, other than noticing this effect, since I was so amazed by the visuals and drawing. These effects on my personality stayed for a week after the trip, and while it is still present, its ease has tapered off quite a bit (it's been three weeks now). I've also started microdosing in an attempt to make speed up my personality development which I've read is an extremely helpful tool for it.

"Hi, so my general question is, can one actively change/improve their IQ or their creativity?

I recently took an IQ test and my scores on visual/spacial tasks were awesome, as well as word comprehension and logic/number sequences. I scored poorly on memory and perception, and did meh on creativity. This interests me because when I was younger took an IQ test and did more average on visual/spacial tasks, poor on word comprehension, reasonable on logic/number sequences, and good on creativity. Sense my youth I had gone to a engineering based high school and worked as a designer on my school's robotics team. Also over the past couple years I have been listening to countless audio books. So I cant help but wonder, did focusing on math, 3D modeling, and audio books these last few years shift my brain from being more creative and sucking with words to being more visual, logical, and (supposedly) awesome with words?

"As an avid lover and daily user of nootropics since 2010, I thought I would try my hand at selling some of the popular products. 3 months ago I picked up 20KG Piracetam wholesale for pretty cheap from a reputable vendor, had the batch lab tested by a third party, and managed to sell just over 10KG. 

As someone who works in the pharmaceutical industry, I'm very familiar with supplement regulation and what can happen if an individual is injured by a product, so as I prepared to scale up, in addition to incorporating my company as an LLC, I looked into providers of product liability insurance. I was shocked at how ridiculously expensive it was for my product class, and some providers would not even consider covering nootropics. So I talked to an attorney friend of mine to really ask how bad could it really be, and basically he told me I should pull all my merch. 

So at this point I'm sitting on \~10KG of deadweight piracetam not really sure how to proceed. Do any of you guys who vend use product liability insurance?

"Hey r/Nootropics! 

I used to go on this sub quite often when I first started school, and bought some noopept (which in my personal case had no effect on me, but that could have been dosing error) and then a while later bought some L-theanine. I was taking L-theanine every morning with my coffee before going into class, so I would leave the bottle in my car. This was in the winter so I didn't think much of it. Eventually I fell off doing that and forgot about my L-theanine until today. 

But alas, months later, and it is now summer in Los Angeles and very, very hot. I'm wondering if the L-theanine is still safe, or should I just buy a new bottle. I am a college student so money isn't free flowing, but also a hospital bill due to ingesting old supplements could be costly.  I know heat can damage or alter a lot of chemicals... Are there even any supplements that could stay in a hot car safely?

TLDR; left L-theanine in hot car for a long time.. is it still safe to ingest?",10,1532917626.0,Nootropics,92wu9e,2,L-theanine left in hot car. Still okay??,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/92wu9e/ltheanine_left_in_hot_car_still_okay/

2. How long for it to start increasing feelings of subjective well being?
3. How long to reduce allergies?
4. Skin improvements?

Please state brand, extract ratio, dosage and duration of consumption.

Thanks!

EDIT: I have been taking it (ND brand, 700mg x2) for 5 days along with white jelly mushroom and I am pretty impressed. I can subjectively 'feel' most nootropics and I'd rather not because the feeling is often in the form of side effects. Literally nothing negative to report with these however, just sleeping better, calmer than usual, not procrastinating as much. Just wondering where it goes from here.

EDIT 2: I don't smoke marijauna often because it makes me a complete couch potato unable to talk or move, but I smoked the last few nights and when I took Reishi before, I was able to be functional whilst high.

EDIT 3: I just want to reinforcement the previous point. Holy shit... these mushrooms have completely blasted whatever mechanism was causing me to respond badly to marijuana, and I feel that this mechanism was probably implicated in other problems I have been having also. As someone on another thread said 'I just feel like everything in my body is working as it should'. 

I also could not tolerate Cordyceps the first time I tried it, but after taking reishi with no cordyceps for 7 days it seems that I can now tolerate it.

"I've always had a problem with sleep. Not that I couldn't fall asleep, but that no matter how much I slept, I would always feel tired again after a few hours. I had already been taking supplements for a while, but never really got much out of anything other than Vitamin D and gym pre-workout. Even Modafinil wasn't helping much while the anxiety it gave me really made it a double-edged sword.

A few months ago, I came across Uridine Monophosphate (UMP) on a video review about nootropics. I did some more research into it and found that I was already taking some supplements ideal for a UMP stack (Omega 3, Vitamin B complex). 

I bought myself some UMP and Alpha GPC (choline) to give it a go, and thew in some Ashwagandha for good luck. 
That was 3 months ago now. 

Where do I begin? My well-being has been more consistent than ever. I still have good and bad days, but after reading Gary Keller's 'The One Thing', I actually now accept that some days I will just have low reserves of 'Will-power'. Come to think of it, I wouldn't even say I have bad days any more. Just good days and great days, with the ""good days"" being my gym-rest days where I just relax back and read. 

One thing that's become very apparent to me is how my sleep has shifted. Before, if I went to bed at 12 then I'd wake up before 8, BUT the later I stayed up, the more sleep I would get. At one point in my life I used to sleep consistently for 12-13 hours a day. Needless to say, I didn't get much accomplished during that period.

But now, I get 7-8 hours sleep no matter what. I just seem to wake up after that many hours and can even reduce the amount of hours by leaving my curtains open before I go to sleep. 

More importantly, I no longer feel like I'm falling asleep in the middle of the day! I can also have conversations with people, which was something I struggled with before because I just could not focus on anything other than my own thoughts. 

I used to flip from depressive phases at home to manic phases, with mania becoming very uncontrollable around friends. This made me disruptive in class and unable to focus on tasks. Now everything just seems consistent. No more switching uncontrollably. Of course I can still feel excitement, but everything is more or less under my control.

I have no idea as to why this stack has more or less completely altered my brain, but since normalising, I have been able to make huge improvements to my life and am incredibly happy and full of gratitude. I feel like I can truly be myself which has lead to be becoming sexually active again as opposed to the previous 8 months where fapping was my form of sexual release. 


The changes have been absolutely remarkable - they truly have. I'd class myself as a very ""well-read"" individual, and now I feel that I can actually apply my knowledge in both conversations and life. Like, I feel I can do anything in the world. If something is REALLY daunting me, then I can just take a gram of phenibut, although I like to limit that to once every fortnight for obvious reasons.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar on this stack (or many a different one)? I'd be interested to hear it!

"Seriously, people need to calm their tits. These are dumb posts and dumb news headlines.


>Preface: I work in the games industry as a developer and manager, but everything I’m telling you here is easily found online with some research. I don’t play any battle royal game (not my bag). And yes, BO4 will still probably sell 20 million titles; that’s a given, but a poor measure of success for a title that used to bring in 40+ million.


First, a strong segement of people play Fortnite on the Switch and Mobile, so they aren’t going anywhere. Second, the last 5 CoD titles didn’t break 5 million in sales combined on the PC; and that’s not likely to change. Third, Fortnite is free, so good luck with that. Finally, people who don’t like shooters like Fortnite, so they aren’t moving over.


A game that should be worried on the other hand is PUBG. From some video comparisons, BO4 is basically a PUBG clone with the graphics and optimizations of BO2; minus the “Iconic Frying Pan”. It’s too bad Bluehole didn’t wait to sue Activision, cause they would have had a much stronger chance of not looking like complete asshats with that case.


And if this game does well and saves Call of Duty from it’s slow cold death, I don’t think that will be a good thing either. Every title would become a battle royal game for the foreseeable future, and I wouldn’t bet against Activision killing off two of the three CoD studios. Does any CoD fan really want that? Cause that’s what will happen.


Never another single player campaign. Battle Royal every year. More loot boxes then you could shake a stick at (literally, billions of loot boxes).


If BO4 breaks 30 million in sales it would reverse CoDs downfall, but would it’s casual nature drive all the pros and life long fans away to CS or Insurgency?


It could be a great success for Activision, but at what cost?

"Since 2012, and the whole ending controversy of ME3, Bioware has basically had an angry mob after it for the past half decade, and I honestly don't get why.

&#x200B;

The company genuinly seems to try to give people what they want, as both Dragon Age 2, Dragon Age Inquisition, and Mass Effect Andromeda all were trying to adress criticisms of their previous entries. Dragon Age Origins wasn't as well recieved on consoles due to the slow, and clunky controls, so Dragon Age 2 tried to make the series more console friendly. Players didn't like how they did that, and complained that Dragon Age 2 was too small, and that they wanted hours of exploration and questing, which they got in Inquisition, seemingly not understanding that getting higher quantity would mean a decrease in quality to a degree to meet demand.

&#x200B;

Similarly with ME Andromeda, people were complaining after ME3 launched that the series had gone against its original vision, that the original game was (at least supposedly) all about exploring alien worlds and discovery, that hopping planet to planet was a core aspect that 2 and 3 were missing, and should have been retained. ME Andromeda brought back the idea of free-form planet exploration, and even structured its entire core premise around giving you exploration and discovery.

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to say their games are perfect, or that they don't make mistakes, (Heck, Bioware themselves devoted an entire side quest in ME3 to basically making fun of themselves) but the sheer amount of vitriol, hatred, and lack of respect towards the hard work of the people working at the company that I've seen in comment sections, forums, and videos is so ridiculous that I don't understand how anyone can justify it.

&#x200B;

And then, with the upcoming Athem, the way I've seen people acting towards any article or bit of information on that game completly confuses me. Bioware has talked multiple times about how they plan to try to handle personal stories and the shared world aspects, have multiple videos of gameplay available, have confirmed in interviews that they will add story content at no additional charge, and that what microtransactions there are will be purly for cosmetic purchases. (And please, keep in mind that if Anthem is meant to last for years, they will need some form of revenue stream to justify the costs of constant development)They have basically said and done every single good thing a company could say before launching a game like Anthem without doing some form of beta or letting people spend hours with the title, and yet all I've still seen around the title is people saying they want Bioware to go out of business, and for Anthem to fail. It is depressing, and some of the most blatent examples of this fetish for exessively hating companies that I've seen from the gaming community for years now.

&#x200B;

I'll say again, Bioware isn't perfect, and I'm not even saying someone needs to buy Anthem, or support Bioware, (I'm personally in a wait and see approach with Anthem myself) but there are real people behind these products.

There are far worse developers then Bioware out there, and I think that there is enough negativity in the world, so maybe, just maybe, people could look at what Bioware has been trying to do over the years, and give credit to the successes and positive changes they, and developers like them, make, instead of only ever harping on about their stumbles and failures.",7,1537251800.0,gaming,9goy0v,1,I don't understand the constant hatred for Bioware.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9goy0v/i_dont_understand_the_constant_hatred_for_bioware/
"Throughout the past few months everybody on this subreddit has been looking for any sign pointing to an announcement from Rocksteady. E3 and Comic-Con passed us up and no announcement. Then, Spider-Man dropped and everyone's been on a superhero high, but still no sign of Rocksteady. Well, there might be some light at the end of the tunnel.

Sometime yesterday on ResetEra, a verified insider posted a comment about Rocksteady's potential release date. In the link - [https://www.resetera.com/threads/could-rocksteady-make-a-marvel-game-and-do-you-want-them-to.68864/#post-12716797](https://www.resetera.com/threads/could-rocksteady-make-a-marvel-game-and-do-you-want-them-to.68864/#post-12716797) \- the poster says: ""They have something that will be anounced either first quarter 2k19 or at E3 depending on the milestones they meet."" The insider, Hasan Ali Almaci, is a video game journalist and an industry vet of 20 years, so I'm sure whatever he says is reputable.

This could mean any number of things. First, we know WB is keen on announcing their titles very close to the release date, so that would probably mean that Rocksteady's game is a 2019 title. Second, we know that WB is also keen on announcing their big AAA titles in the beginning of the year for a fall release, so this is very likely. Third, Rocksteady have been tweeting about meeting milestones quite a few times. Usually these milestones are significant in judging when a game is presentable to the public. Rocksteady has already gone through a few of those, so we are probably nearing close to an announcement.

Rocksteady just put out a job ad for a community manager. Community Managers are only needed when a product is about to be introduced to the masses and they need to keep the image of the product in check with the consumer. This definitely means Rocksteady is ready for a big promotional push.

I would expect their announcement to come sometime between late February to early March. These are when their past two AAA games (Arkham Knight and Shadow of War) were announced.

Lastly, Rocksteady has gone on record saying that their next game would be a decision between ""them, WB, and DC"", Which means that whatever it is, it is a DC project. Whether that's Superman, another Batman, or the entire Justice League is up for speculation(though I'm leaning towards Superman from other evidence), but it should be exciting when we find out in six months time.

TL;DR: ResetEra insider said Rocksteady should have game announcement in Q1 2019.",2,1537251693.0,gaming,9goxk6,2,Rocksteady Announcement Date - Q1 2019,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9goxk6/rocksteady_announcement_date_q1_2019/

"***This  is just a rough sketch, some very rudimentary ideas thrown on  paper...er, a webpage...this is by no means a complete game idea, just a  bunch of random thoughts thrown out there. If people have other ideas  or think this is good stuff, I'll make a more serious game document. At  this point I don't even know if people would be interested in a game of  this complexity or not. I've always dreamed of making ""the ultimate""  galactic strategy game...something like aurora 4x or distant stars but  with even more meat on the bones. While I am a programmer, I don't have the kind of know-how to even get a bare-bones model of this working...but I would be interested to know if people find this idea interesting...perhaps with some more work I could get a team together that could get a basic model of this going...***

The  game will be a real-time, pausable strategy game. It will take place in  a randomized galaxy that can be customized according to a few  parameters. There will be a certain number of races in any given game,  each with their own unique gameplay style.

The Player

The  player will play the role of a galactic statesman, guiding his faction  from humble pre-warpdrive era to galactic empire-hood. The player will  have some control of the economy, can direct colonization, can govern  planets or assign planetary governors, can direct fleets or appoint  admirals, can conduct espionage, can direct construction of planetary  infrastructure, space-stations, star-ships, and even  super-weapons...players will also direct diplomacy, signing treaties and  other such actions.

The player will be  able to design star-ships and star-bases, using many different  components, or they can buy designs from private companies. Everything  will be customizable...even the components themselves. The player can  design engines or laser emplacements if they choose (or buy specialized  ones from private companies) the only limiting factor is technological  levels, weight, and cost.

Super-weapons  will play a role in the game...they are massive and can be  customized...ultimately the player can even destroy entire star systems,  though they will suffer a massive diplomatic penalty for doing so.

There  will be several different resources in game, each of which are required  for building and maintaining certain components. Some areas of the  galaxy will be more rich than others, creating asymmetric game-play and  encouraging economic warfare

DIPLOMACY:  
The  player can sign mutual defense treaties, line-of-sight sharing  treaties, formal alliances, and federation treaties (federation treaties  are alliances but between multiple empires, not just one). They can  alternately close borders, declare war, and embargo other empires.

ECONOMIC MODEL:

As  time goes by, each empire will start to have certain private companies  arise, there will be mainly three types of industry: mining, trade, and  military. These industries will arise without the player's direct  control, thus simulating actual economic growth. However the player can  interact with the companies by subsidizing or leveling tariffs, building  infrastructure for them or conversely seizing assets, and some  government types will even allow the player to nationalize a industry  entirely, though doing so will be risky as it could cause other  industries to move away from one's empire.  The strength of each company  will be determined from the relative strength of the player's empire,  population, low company tax rates, and certain policies.

Mining  Companies – almost focus solely on mining planets and asteroids, can be  nationalized, player can subsidize or level tariffs, can be granted  mining charters to build mining colonies, which are semi-independent  extensions of the host empire the mining company comes from, which  cannot be controlled by the player but have increased tax revenue

Trading  companies – focus on trading with other planets within one's empire,  and can trade outside the empire with other races if certain policies  (like free-trade) are passed can be nationalized, player can subsidize  or level tarrifs

Military Companies - can  be nationalized, player can subsidize or level tariffs, military  companies create designs and can be assigned research tasks for certain  military related tech, the player can buy designs or order a certain  number of ships from the military company…

Different economic policies:

Free  trade – allows trading companies to trade with all  empires, you make  less money off of taxes and you can't level tariffs on the trade  companies, but you get a diplomatic realtions bost with the other  empires...they get a small boost to their income depending on your  economic power...

Restricted trade – same  as free trade but you can select which empires you want the companies  to trade with...this helps if you are conducting economic warfare with  another empire

Allow Mining Colonies –  allows the construction of semi-indepedent mining colonies that you  cannot control of directly tax, but they extend your borders just like a  normal colony and give a boost to the resrouce output of the mining  stations in the system

Don't Allow Mining Colonies – duh

Allow  private armies – allows all companies to build private armies, which  function to protect them from pirate and raider attacks, this can be  dangerous however, as if you anger or attempt to nationalize a industry  and their army is strong enough, they may go to war with you

Dis-allow  private armies – no private armies are allowed...however you must  protect the company from private attacks...if you don't then they may  decide to build a private army anyway\*

Hello, Gamers! We, are the Dark Crystal Games, new indie studio.

Right now we working on a game of our dreams - Encased: a sci-fi post-apocalyptic RPG. One of the main ideas of our studio is involving the community into the developing  process. On the current stage, everyone can add his biography in [C.R.O.N.U.S candidate's form](https://cronus.darkcrystalgames.com/en/). The most interesting will be added to the Encased as actual NPCs!

We already got 1400 character biographies from our community, from one of the forms was born this guy Ville Luoma:

But the world under the Dome is HUGE, and we want to add many more characters with the unique stories to this world. According to the history of our game, more than 30.000 people live under the dome!

Our writers are already going crazy with the stories of people that player came with :)

We want to ask you, real gamers, to help us make the world in Encased more alive and awesome.

"I went back to playing Ark when Monster Hunter released. Had no regrets. At my first look at the BO4 trailer, I was blown away. Then I thought about where I have seen this kind of gameplay before because it doesn't seem so new to me. Then I remembered Battlefield 2. Being someone that was really happy with Ark instead of Monster Hunter, I kind of wonder if I will be happy going back to BF2 when BO4 drops or not.

I think for me, it might come down to how much the zombies are used in BO4. BF2 simply has no zombies by default. I like zombies. Though I actually like that there isn't a shrinking area in bf2. I am not really into looking for loots to use either.  I like being combat ready ahead of time. I should enter the war zone prepared in my opinion. So I figure the games are about even so far. One lacks zombies and the other isn't basically silly.

Then I read that the devs are thinking about eliminating teamkilling in BO4. I suddenly wanted to play it for the teamkilling part. There isn't a point to tking in BF2. Tking in BO4 seems like a ton of intrigue, fun.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I will totally buy BO4 if I can tk for the gear of my teammate. If not, I probably will personally stick with BF2 because it is a bit less silly in terms of the arrival to battle. So what is make or break for you? Maybe for you it is a different game that you will look back to. Maybe you want BO4 no matter what. The two person quads did look sweet. Let me know if you like a different game that might save me some money or whatever you think.

In some cases, toning down the graphics is necessary. Obviously, if the computer is lagging, this is needed, but even when it isn't, I've had games where I can't read the tiny text in high res.

"So im into dinosaurs and monster's in video games (dont judge it's just my favorite theme) i have the money for either Monster Hunter World or Ark Survival. Now ik the reviews for Monster Hunter World are absolutely stellar wheras Ark's reviews differ. However im not necessarily looking for the better game, but a game with more of a feel of fighting against actual dinosaur-y monster things and occasionally even winning. Then the other thing i want is for the game to be good for sinking forever into and just having a laugh with my friend whenever i turn it on (a laugh, not just playing with)

Edit: if neither then any other suggestions?

TL;DR - which one for larking about with mates and sinking a long time into which has a good atmosphere of nature.

"That was the greatest console generation of my time and I could never own all three because I was a child back then.  Its a part of my childhood that just never feel complete.

There were a lot of good games on all three system.  There more Xbox exclusive than the 360 and Xbox One era probably combine.  Gunvalkyrie, Gunmetal, Panzer Dragoon Orta, Bloodwake, Quantum Redshift, Apex, Kingdom Under Fire, Fable and Project Gotham Racing just to name a few.  There was just more variety and way more unique games back then, and it was also the era where innovation was starting and developers were full of passion.

"So I got a Switch a while back and a handful of games. I only really played Zelda and Mario Kart and those were the main reasons I got it.

I play PC mainly, but those exclusives are damn enticing. I have an Xbox One, but once I built my computer I only played Madden on it. I let my brother play it now, but I don’t want to invest in another console that I end up not being interested in anymore. 

I guess what I’m asking is for your experiences with the PS4/Switch. Should I wait for a certain release that could sway me away, stick to PC and never be Spider-Man, or do you believe the PS4 is a worthy investment, even if just for the exclusives?

TL;DR: Don’t play my Switch anymore. I want to be spider-man. Don’t want  another console collecting dust. PS4 worth it?

* The other one consist of a couple of games, but i only remember one of them, the one i member is a maze game some of the parts of the maze were clouds, idc if I'm unable to find this one but i would like to play it again if possible

* The third one and the one i REALLY want is a sandbox game?? Idk what this genre is but you had a 2d square and some menus, you had to take building blocks and put them there, there was some liquids as well, but the best part is that everything interacts with each other like how putting some blocks changes how the grass looks like, there were some sand as well lol, also the game consists of two modes, sandbox and missions i think but I'm not to sure that there was some wires and heat and what not so like an experiment

Please comment what is the name of this game because i REALLY REALLY want to play it again, also i might have discribed some things wrong here because my memory isn't that vivid because i was like 7 when i first played it but i think the game was from 2000-2007~

"Hi guys.

I played BO4 beta for 2 days and I really liked the game. Only problem is that we must wait for almost a month for a full release.

I previously played CS 1.6, CS:GO and PUBG but I am getting bored of these games.

So, is there any game that has similar gameplay like Black Ops 4 so I can play until BO4 comes out in October?

So basically let’s say I hypothetically wanted to play a bored game/tabletop game with someone I met online and the loser has to do some sort of forfeit.  Those details aren’t important here but basically it would have to be a game competitive and relatively short enough. 

Maybe a game with rounds so each round can have a loser? 

Maybe a game that’s provocative in some way in itself?

So basically in summary. Trying to figure out if tabletop simulator would logistically work well for this sort of thing and if so I’d love game recommendations?

"Here's the thing,

I currently have a PC with a GTX770 build 5 years ago and no consoles, I'm in need of an upgrade to my gaming.

With Smash Bro's coming out I really want a Switch in december so that's something I'm gonna get anyway.

All my best friends are on Xbox so I always play alone on my PC and I would love to play FIFA and Black ops with them.

&#x200B;

I have two options as I see it:

I buy an Xbox One X as a 'replacement' for my pc to play with my friends and use as my primairy gaming platform and let my PC be for the coming year or two. Plus miss out on all the PS4 exclusives.

Or,

Buy a PS4 Pro as that would be the 'logical' choice for a PC gamer since games like God of War and Spiderman are games I wouldn't want to miss, and upgrade my PC. This would mean not being able to play with my friends but having access to more games I would'nt be able to play otherwise.

&#x200B;

I could buy a PS4 a few years from now since the games mentioned are singleplayer..

&#x200B;

Would an Xbox One X be a stupid investment for me?

"When i was young i liked to play Civ 2, at some point a friend introduced me to Alpha Centauri and i just loved that game:   
finally borders, AI personalities, the tech tree, unit creator, the story and for sure the videos and quotes.

I even love the style and the music but that might be nostalgia, however even without nostalgia glasses it was/is a really great game and nothing compares to it.

In my opinion it just needs better AI and updated graphics for widescreen.

Civilization still is successful but it developed in a way i don't like, so i really wonder why alpha centauri doesn't get any love, like a remake or even a second part (pls forget beyound earth).

Hey All. After doing a bit of online browsing I may have found a Nintendo Switch for sale in my area for half the retail price. I’m thinking about making a bid, but I was also a bit hesitant with the news of the Switch’s virtual console, as well as many of its other online features, which have been somewhat of a disappointment. Perhaps the biggest concern, however, is the chances of any games on the Nintendo e-shop end up going on sale. 

There are many superb indie titles and even cartridges that I’d love to get for the Switch, but I’m also skeptical since Nintendo products hardly go on sale to the best of my judgement. I compare this to my PS Vita, which not only has games for sale regularly, but also has the cross-buy option with my PS4. I know that a lot of people would encourage me to go forward with the Switch, saying it’s the future of indie games and handheld consoles and whatnot, but I almost wonder if it’d be worth it to wait a bit longer for the inevitable refurbished model, as well as a chance that they’ll start adding sales to their e-Shop (as well as a shimmer of hope for a Paper Mario port). What to you guys think on the matter? I’d love to get some genuine input from the community. :)

" Seriously, 90% of open world games have this. I'd rather have a small amount of meaningful sidequests and a small amount of collectibles that add to the game world than a map full of meaningless things to do. Every Ubisoft open world game tends to fill your entire map with 100 collectibles and sidequests that are so repetitive and boring that I'd rather drag my testicles through sand. If you want to 100% an Ubisoft open world game then get ready to get bored to death while collecting collectibles.

 Don't even get me started on the ""constant action"" meta that Ubisoft seems to have adopted recently. In Far Cry 5 you can't breathe for more than 10 seconds because there's always cultists chasing you. In AC: Origins, there's those phylakitai that get instantly triggered whenever you go past them. Why would I want this? Why would I want to get chased by 20 fucking morons when I'm roaming?

&#x200B;

 I really don't understand why some companies are so obsessed with filling your map with tons of crap just to call it content. I don't feel fulfilled if the game wants me to collect hundreds of stupid collectibles, I don't feel fulfilled if you have 40 side quests and all of them are the same with no interesting story/characters. I just hate this direction that most open world games are headed to, and I think it's because a lot of people have this ""$1/hour"" flawed mentality and they don't feel like the game's worth $60 if they can't get 60 hours out of it. Would you rather have hundreds of hours of boring, repetitive content or would you have 20-30 hours of great content?",8,1537216212.0,gaming,9gjwf4,5,[rant] I hate the meaningless filler content in games.,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9gjwf4/rant_i_hate_the_meaningless_filler_content_in/
"The skyrocketing cost of developing an AAA game is worrying me. While the cost is at an astronomical high, the price of video games are still relatively the same. Companies have to sell more copies to break even, and whatever profits they get are too small imo.

Can anyone who actually works in the industry chime in and give some projections? I don’t want to entertain the thought that my primary hobby is dying.

"One of my favorite things about playing video games is finding new experiences that are equal to or surpass previous ones. I maintain a list of my Top 25 Greatest Video Games ever and update it regularly whenever I beat something that I think deserves a spot over a lower entry. I'm interested in hearing from other gamers about whether they think about what they consider the greatest game ever and what criteria they use when making that declaration.

&#x200B;

This is particularly on my mind right now as last night I beat The Last of Us for the first time, and I think it might be the new No. 1 on my list. Final Fantasy VII has been firmly entrenched there ever since I beat it for the first time a couple of years ago, and I wasn't sure any game was going to be able to top it (though The Witcher 3 came damn close). But The Last of Us is really unlike anything I've played before and it has stuck with me big time over the last 24-hours and has affected me more than any other game has following its conclusion. I actually feel a sort of emptiness now that it's over, not because I was saddened or disappointed by the ending, but because that experience is over and it will never be replicated again.",19,1537192702.0,gaming,9ghs2o,0,The Greatest Video Game of All Time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9ghs2o/the_greatest_video_game_of_all_time/

"Listen i know its a big topic but lemme explain myself first. Yes, its about fortnite. But as i first started off before it blew up i enjoyed the game sort of but im not the type of person to really bandwagon on popular subjects, i usually try to be the different one. So when fortnite became popular i naturally despised it. I stopped playing it and even hated it at a point, though there was really nothing wrong with it. Ive had a point for awhile about fortnite being the culling(if you dont know what that is its another BR that came out before they blew up) the game basically focused on what the community wanted and naturally they all split up because they would nerf and buff everything not thinking about how it affected the game itself. Now i believe fortnite is doing the same, like adding new weapons, items, etc. But i respect the game because it reminds the Minecraft age where that was the huge thing. Though it had that feeling and it fit in fortnite is much much too toxic for that. Those are my thoughts on the game please dont hate i just wanted to state my thoughts.

"I love playing Dva. Everything about her kit, I originally chose playing Dva because she reminded me of gaige (BL2) at first and then just got so lost I'm the awesomeness of her kit that she became my default pick. Which also brings me into the topic of why I chose overwatch over similar titles.

Blizzard did a better job of creating a pvp game with graphics and character design that was reminiscent of Borderlands than Gearbox did (just my opinion, but Battleborn was a complete waste) and Borderlands belongs to Gearbox.

I still love playing other heroes, Sombra being one of the top on my list.

That said, whenever the heck Gearbox decides to release BL3, I would personally love for one of the vault hunters to be reminiscent of Sombra. The whole going invisible, denying enemy abilities, translocating to a safer position. Obviously they couldn't just copy all of her abilities, but they could do something similar.

"Hi guys. I'd like to ask for help to remember a game.


It was several years ago. Like 2004 or 2005. I had a old computer so I guess the game was older than that. It wasn't really a game but a demo.


The menu had some options in a row with buttons. I don't remember if it was in the top of the screen or in the left. I remember the graphics of the menu looking like metal.

During the gameplay there was this like desert level. More like mars level. I don't remember if game had objectives but in that level the enemies were monsters similar to spiders, orange just like the color of the map. The map had some ""mountains"" they were really narrow. Just enough space for the character. Which had some master chief like armor.

You could access this little mountains with a jetpack. It had very little capacity and you activated it with space bar the thrusters just turned on while you were pressing space bar.

There was another map with vegetation and maybe water.

But... you know, if its the same formula of ""defeat 8 bosses, then some Wily castle, cue credits"", I feel like that would be super underwhelming.

But... if they added additional playable characters, and maybe some difficult unlockable stuff, I could see getting a LOT of mileage out of the game.

Proto Man, Bass, and Roll are all obvious choices. X and Zero could also be fun, though unsure how Capcom would feel having them meet the classic cast, even if it wasn't canon.

Maybe tap into the cancelled ""Mega Man Universe"" and have Capcom characters from othsr series'? Playable Ryu from Street Fighter, Arthur from Ghosts n Ghouls, maybe even Ryu from the Breath of Fire series?

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the open world  setting with the ability to pick different objectives, but that the feeling of  progression could still be achieved and leave me feeling fulfilled if maybe 5-10 other goals opened up instead of what feels like 15-25. It's too much and gives me this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.

If the amount of objectives that opened up was less and the map stayed  zoomed in so it seemed like I opened up a decent amount of area (even  though it's actually quite small) then I would feel accomplished without feeling overwhelmed and I would get that feeling more often since I would be opening up the world more often. I feel this way with most Ubisoft games and a few other games that seem to follow the Assassins Creed formula.

Some examples of games that I have played which made me feel this way include: Assassins Creed 4, AC Rogue, Watchdogs 2, Horizon Zero Dawn.",5,1537182833.0,gaming,9ggtg3,3,"(Ubisoft) Am I the only one who gets overwhelmed when all 10,000 goals open up once a new area is unlocked?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9ggtg3/ubisoft_am_i_the_only_one_who_gets_overwhelmed/

"In 2013 GTA 5 was really enjoyable the story was great and online took about 30 days to get going but was really fun. Everything was obtainable and costed reasonably. 
2 years later  the Heist update was added and was a turning point for online. 
Ridiculously priced yachts and lowriders came out.  Then futurezation vehicles plagued the game. Today try going into a lobby without flying cars and motorcycles and hover bikes. The point is the game online game I liked I can't play anymore.

Now I liked undead nightmare, but it did turn a grounded western into a b roll science fiction film. The tone of the experience changed.

"I've been playing KF2 for about few weeks and I'm having some problems with the game, and I would like to say that I do love KF2 it's just these things are just bothering me.

1. Randomly throwing cash or (Dosh) 
2. Killing ""Zeds"" and earning randomly numbered of Cash (Dosh)
3. Random slow motions that aren't necessary 
4. Bosses that phase through the player when escaping 
5. Need more bosses

So question one. When starting the match or in the middle I wandered around to where the ""Zeds"" will come from or in the middle of a match I'll try to find some ""Zeds"" that is in the map. Then at random my cash (Dosh) would come out..it's distracting and annoying when you are trying to save up some weapons and armor for the next round. Is this the games doing or is it a bug that I'm having here..

Question two. When killing different ""Zeds"" you'll earn cash (dosh) but the amount is absolutely random.. you can kill a gaint ""Zed"" and earn 17-24 cash (Dosh) by myself of course... I can see that when multiple people killing the same ""Zed"" wil lower the cash (Dosh) amount but you will get just ONE cash (Dosh)...what the hell.. We need certain amount of cash (Dosh) when killing specific ""Zed"" and when multiple players killing the same ""Zed"" the cash should be divided equally or who shot it first when the numbers are odd

Question three. When the match started or when wave of ""Zeds"" are coming a random slow motion happens..we didn't kill a single ""Zed"" and a slow motion happens..like really that's unnecessary and at the end of the match another slow motion happens again..it SHOULD be a ability that's rechargable or buy one in store that a certain of amount of THREE slow motions. Because you can hear multiple slow motions happening at the same time and it wastes every time..

Question four. The only boss (..well there are ONLY two but eh..I'll get to that later) that I'm only having a problem with is ""Patriarch"" if you don't know who he is, he's the guy with the shades and a mini gun that replaced his left arm. He can be very unbalanced with his none stop missles and almost have his health back when he turns invisible and gets away..like I understand the bosses are supposed to be difficult but this only boss will phase through us and almost have his health back and will kill almost all our players with nine stop rockets..there SHOULD he a cool down timer or how many times he can use it (the missles, regenerating health, and turning invisible) like cmon...

I would like to say to question two and four. When playing different difficulty from ""Normal"" to ""Hell on Earth"" there's should be different a amount of chash (Dosh) we should get from maybe..Higher on ""Normal"" and Lower on ""Hell on Earth"" that way there's a challenge or other way around..idk (I'm gonna say NO random amount..just figure out what certain amount of cash (dosh) there should be when one player is killing a ""Zed"" from multiple players killing that singel ""Zed"" THEN the amount will be small and be equally divided or the person who shot it first gets what's left when it's odd) and the Bosses okay..I can see regenerating health happening when the difficulty is up or when the docotor turn on his shield to protect himself but on different difficulty there should be a difference...

Question four. KF2 came out on idk 2015 or 16 you can tell me in the comments. We need more unique bosses so we can have more fun and a challange..like theirs only TWO bosses..come on game developers..

So those are my four questions that I have in my mind. I would love your feed back on the game and tell me what's going on.

"..please remember that this is how they make a vast majority of their profit. They get very little selling new games (almost nothing, really), so purchasing games at a low-price, and selling them just slightly below the price of new games, is how they continue to operate as a business. Their competitors are not only brick-and-mortar businesses like Walmart, but online retailers like Amazon. If they gave you more for your games, they probably wouldn't be able to continue functioning which would leave most areas with no video game store they can go to. 

Some may argue this is a good thing, but for me personally, there are times when I want to buy a physical game without having to support a company like Walmart, or wait for shipping. Also, it's nice being able to buy a game knowing you can return if you don't like it (Gamestop has a very lenient 7-day return policy on used games, where they let you return it for full value simply for not liking it).",12,1537174850.0,gaming,9gfw5e,0,For those who complain about Gamestop's admittedly ridiculous trade-in values..,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9gfw5e/for_those_who_complain_about_gamestops_admittedly/

8Gb RAM
GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 850M

I see my three options as:
1) upgrade to a modern gaming laptop and play on small screen
2) same as option one but find a monitor and play off of that (will I have issues?
3) build a PC (lack of space and max judgement from wife)

"The game starts *in media res* (in the middle of things). You’re a ship: pirate captain, and your first mate comes to your cabin and says in a hushed tone that there’s talk of mutiny. The crew, it seems, is sick of being chased relentlessly by the marauding pirate that has sworn revenge on you, for reasons still unknown. Many have scars from past battles, and empty bunks where friends and brothers once slept.


Most of the game is being a marauding pirate yourself - keeping your crew at bay. But the main objective is having enough gold/ certain artifacts that your nemesis pirate has requested to let him spare your life the next time he finds you.



Because, he *always* finds you. It’s like Alien: Isolation but at sea. He is the only one you fear, and it would be foolish not to fear him. You don’t know when he’ll arrive, but avoiding him at all costs is your main objective. 



You know he’s near from his distinctive battle cry from across the horizon.



You’re sailing, and suddenly you hear a faint “waaaaa” in the distance, and you know you’re hour has come.


You look and see the purple sails in the distance as some of your men begin to jump overboard, preferring whatever unknown horrors the deep may offer rather than face the lanky and merciless hellbeast that now approaches.



You say a prayer as you begin to make out the “W” on the sails, but God is hiding too.

"I don't understand what all the hype is about at all. I have played the game and the other Spiderman games AND watched all the Spiderman movies and can tell you right now that while this may be the only Spiderman game on the Playstation 4, it's not worth all the praise it's getting at all.

Some of the reasons this game is DECENT but not even close to AMAZING:

- Combat is a shittier Arkham series combat version. They spaced it out to defend with circle and the Arkham version where you defend with triangle is so much better in every way.

- Side missions are a complete joke. They are repetitive, tedious, and feel like a grind more than a game.

- Lazy design when it comes to people. I'm not saying this game should be on par with GTA V, because you're probably not going to be walking on the street for most of the game, but they could have at least TRIED. You go down there and you look at a group of people and you see 10 people who are the same model and you know these guys didn't even try.

- Music isn't that good. It's powerful at times, but it's always the same sequence with the trumpets. Literally on playback for the entire game, starts to sound more like torture by the end of the game. It's not varied or dynamic and is literally just a repetition of the same tune over and over again. This detracts a LOT from the experience.

- The story is not only bad, it's also mostly ripped off from Arkham knight. The whole villain takes a toxin and releases it on the city thing got old back in 2013 when Batman did it first, and was even older when the first Batman film did it before any game did.

- Romantic plotline is laid on a bit too thick. It's corny and cringe at times.

- MJ and Miles going around playing ninja and putting themselves in harms way is ridiculous.

- MJ and Miles stealth sequences are fun but repetitive. They become tedious towards the end.

- Villains absolutely suck. They look like a group of circus rejects, more than menacing villains trying to take down Spiderman. Some of them are pretty spot on in regards to the comic, but putting a villain as boring as Mr Negative front and center makes the entire first half of the game feel like a snooze fest.

- Doc Ock sounds like a whiney 12 year old. And it's even harder to take him seriously after watching Spiderman 2.

- Nobody ever feels like they are in actual danger. I know it's a Marvel game, but not once did it seem like things were going bad for the good guys. Sure Peter gets beat down a couple of times, but the lack of emotional depth to the damage taken makes it stupid, not deep.

- No dynamic suit damage as the game progresses.

- No Raimi suit. Insomniac is free to do whatever they want with their game, but disrespecting the franchise that started it all and putting in the MCU suits is pretty petulant.

I know i'm going to get downvoted in hordes by fanboys, because of recency bias, but as far as i'm concerned this is an unpopular opinion and would love to hear what you guys have to say about this.",19,1537156611.0,gaming,9gdlly,0,Spiderman PS4 is a bit overhyped [Spoilers!],https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9gdlly/spiderman_ps4_is_a_bit_overhyped_spoilers/

"I built my computer just over a year and a half ago. I played csgo and call of duty on steam, and fortnite. Just recently none of my steam games where launching and it came up with a disk read error. I decided to reset my computer to get rid of all the other applications I don't use anymore, and to speed up the use of the computer. I installed all the graphics and motherboard drivers and then installed fortnite and csgo because it was not the big of a download. When I tried to launch csgo, the same disk read error came up. And when I tried to play fortnite, the game would either go black while loading in, or come up with the error, (0xC0030004). I tried the link it provided me, but nothing there helped.

**Hallinan:** The majority of people believe that it is a symbol of heritage, that it is a symbol of our history, that people think is associated with the South, and the South was fighting for slavery — that’s a common misconception about what actually took place. When you study the history, that was one thing that the war was about. People don’t go to war for one issue.”

**Interviewer:** Name three other things the war was about.

**Hallinan:** Uh, I mean, I’m not a historian. I mean, you’re putting me on the spot for something I — you know.

**Interviewer:** So we got one thing the war was about -- slavery. What are two other things that the war was about.

**Hallinan:** Um, um, the Confederate... the, uh, um... in general, the war was about tyranny.

**Interviewer:** What is tyranny?

**Hallinan:** Tyranny is any time a government overreaches, and they control a life too much.”

"[Francis Fukuyama Postpones the End of History](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/03/francis-fukuyama-postpones-the-end-of-history)

Highlights:

>...Fukuyama covers all of this in less than two hundred pages. How does he do it?  
>  
>Not well. Some of the problem comes from misunderstanding figures like Beauvoir and Freud...

&#x200B;

>Fukuyama defines *thymos* as “the seat of judgments of worth.” This seems a semantic overreach. In the Republic, Socrates associates *thymos* with children and dogs, beings whose reactions need to be controlled by reason. 

&#x200B;

>Fukuyama resorts to this tactic because he wants to do with the desire for recognition what he did with liberalism in “The End of History?” He wants to universalize it. This allows him to argue, for example, that the feelings that led to the rise of Vladimir Putin are exactly the same (albeit “on a larger scale”) as the feelings of a woman who complains that her potential is limited by gender discrimination. The woman can’t help it. She needs the serotonin, just like the Russians.

"""John was a very engaging guy,"" Shover recalls. ""You could not help but like John.""
But McCain still had a political Achilles' heel. As a recent Valley transplant, he looked like a carpetbagger, and critics instantly seized the issue.

How McCain finally squelched the charge has become part of Arizona political lore.
At a 1982 candidates forum, McCain ""snapped,"" to use his own word, after somebody brought up his residency ""for the thousandth time."" Here is what he said:

""Listen, pal. I spent 22 years in the Navy. My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.""

The issue never came up again.

"Do not order anything from Carlos Pizza and grill, I just got bitched at by the delivery guy for having to bring me another poutine because they put shawarma sauce on it.He said i should make my order more simple and he said ""you made me drive all the way back for this.When i called to complain the guy said ya he's mad. It's actually not even the first time iv'e been bitched at by them for them messing up my order and they had to fix it by bringing what i ordered in the first place.They have messed up our order so many times,and i have found strange things in my food, i don't know why keep on ordering food from them.After 9 years of eating their food ...IM DONE! I have never been talked to like this from any other ""restaurant"". Isn't it supposed to be the customer is always rite?Have anyone been told by an employee of a restaurant to make their order more simple so they don't mess it up? (its family owned)
THIS WAS THEIR RESPONSE!! What do you think?
Carlo's Pizza & Grill
Carlo's Pizza & Grill Hello, Michelle!

We're sorry to hear about your negative experience. We want to let you know that, on behalf of Carlo's Pizza & Grill, we deeply and sincerely apologize from the bottom of our hea—oh wait, no, we're an independent place; we can dispense with the usual franchise drivel.

We both know that this has been a long time coming. Where do we begin? First, your orders are indeed unnecessarily complex (and that's saying a lot—we have some experience taking them). This day, your order was one four-topping panzerotti (for the record, we have a three-topping limit), two large shawarma poutines, two large plain poutines (one with chicken; one with chicken, extra cheese, and extra gravy), all four of said poutines crispy, two garlic ranch dipping sauces, one shawarma garlic dipping sauce, and four ""extra chicken on the side"" (a special request only for you that we've obliged through the years and seriously undersold).

We take our orders by pen and paper, not electronically. Everything except the panzerotti has to be written within a space that is just a few square inches (normally reserved for one or two side orders). The difficulty is compounded when you took over five minutes in placing the order when the average is 23 seconds (yes, we averaged it out; again, have some experience). The difficulty is further compounded when you don't have the order ready when you call and constantly change the phrasing of the order or don't know the menu (as you've been told SEVERAL times, 'poutine with chicken and garlic sauce' = 'shawarma poutine'; ""chicken poutine"" is not a term on our menu because it is ambiguous as to whether or not garlic sauce is wanted). Your orders always stick out like a sore thumb. Our order takers dread them, our cooks despise them, and our delivery drivers curse them (hence, the ""bitching at"" in question).

Naturally, your entire order—as yours often are—had to be re-written in order to make it legible after all the changes and poor phrasing choices. It was during this re-writing phase that the order taker understandably erred (as humans do) and wrote 'extra garlic sauce' instead of 'extra gravy' on one of the poutines. If we ever only make one mistake on your order anywhere along the line, it is a minor miracle. When we usually make your orders and there are no mistakes, we rejoice and thank the gods for their holy blessing, as no mortal can accomplish that preposterous feat unaided by divine intervention.

Your family has indeed been ordering for many years and we too question why you keep coming back, if you're apparently so dissatisfied with us. We're not sure to what you’re referring when you vaguely say ""strange things in your food"". If we're being honest, we recall only one instance a few years ago of a rubber sleeve that fell off of a new gravy warmer lid that was in one of your poutines (which is really a manufacturer's flaw with the warmer) for which we happily compensated you. We recall another instance where you knocked on our door after closing hours to have us redo a salad that was ""too watery""…after ordering extra dressing. 

We sometimes wonder whether your orders are confusing on purpose. ""The customer is always right"" is often-repeated corporate tripe so that those higher up in the company ladder don't have to deal with customer complaints and the guys at the bottom at customer service have to put up with absolutely everything, no matter how disingenuous or insane. At the end of the day, we will not miss your business in the least bit. We are thrilled at the prospect of never having to serve you again, either for take-out or delivery. This goes for any other customer who shares the same ""customer is always right"" mentality; for every one of you, we have countless loyal and reasonable customers we are happy to serve and deal with if any problems should arise.

Good day to you, madame. Have a good one.

—CP&G

P.S. This makes the SECOND time your family has vowed never to order from us again: the first was a few years ago after another salad debacle—you started coming back a while afterwards. Please keep your word this time (we will hold you to it)!",18,1530751309.0,MurderedByWords,8w31am,148,An obnoxious customer and a murder response,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/8w31am/an_obnoxious_customer_and_a_murder_response/

"Hello, hello!

Please give a warm welcome to our new mods! Here they are, as well as an intro they wrote about themselves:

* u/farmerlesbian: Hey, most folks call me ""farmer"". i'm not a real farmer, but i am a real lesbian. i love onions; vidalias are the best onions and i will go to the mat on that. i like to cook, watch terrible reality tv shows, and dedicate my life to a mobile fish game. i moderate r/Abyssrium
* u/Phallindrome: Hey y'all, i'm from BC and I've been onion-neutral since before i joined reddit. I'm a biology student, my hobbies include gardening and origami.
* u/Synocity: Hello all! I’m Synocity. I’m a broke college student studying accounting and finance (yeah, boring right?). Honestly, onions aren’t good unless you fry them, but that can be said about a lot of things. When I’m not browsing Reddit, you’ll likely find me playing video games (Rocket League is the best game, you can’t debate this). Other than that I live the typical boring accountant life...
* u/Birdy1072: We don't have a bio for them yet, but I'm sure this will be fitting - Hi, I'm Birdy1072, and I hate onions. Loathe them, actually. Onions have no place in everyday life and should be eliminated from the earth as we know them. I also mod r/LetsNotMeet.
* u/Baldemoto: Hello everyone! I’m Baldemoto. I’m an onion hater, a male human being, and a Reddit addict, in that order. I love to moderate communities that I genuinely enjoy seeing and interacting with to help see them grow, and this just so happened to be one of those subreddits! I love to draw and swim, and my shoe size is 13. I also mod r/LetsNotMeet. I don’t think you need to know anything else except that I will do my best to make this community as great as it can possibly be!
* u/feldma: Hello, I’m /u/feldma and I’m the newest mod from down under. I am a massive nerd, and spend a ~~sad~~ considerable amount of time on robotics and programming. Whilst I do not have much experience moderating on Reddit, I have 5+ years of moderating experience on gaming communities and their respective forums. ^(Do I have to talk about onions? Yes? Fine.) I’m Australian, and Aussie’s like sausages, and good sausages require onions, so I guess I am pro-onion…? (Oh, and if you happen to like Doctor Who with too much enthusiasm, message me and we can have a nerd-off :D)
* u/HouseSomalian: I'm onion-neutral, pineapple positive, and addicted to reddit.  I mod more than 1 subreddit, but less than 1000.  I've never broken a bone, but I've broken several fingernails.  I can't remember the title of my favorite movie, but it's the one where there are plot holes.  I once got an A in a class, another time I got an F.  I live east of hawaii and south of svalbard.  I speak english fluently.

Also-- here's a look at our results from the survey:

[Sorry- I removed the \\""other...\\"" responses, but marked the closest bubble that they matched.](https://i.redd.it/u0c27y1viv611.png)

I'll edit this post with some more cohesive results when I get a chance.

Since we had such a high number of people respond that they liked the 'only allow murders' option, we're looking at holding a trial week where only murders are allowed. This idea is still in the formative stage, but we're still excited about the result's we'll get. Stay tuned for more information.

Other than that, I've got nothing else. As always, questions and... well comments are always encouraged!",29,1530278192.0,MurderedByWords,8uqkv0,115,New moderators and the feedback we've gotten- what's next?,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/8uqkv0/new_moderators_and_the_feedback_weve_gotten_whats/

"Hey /r/MurderedByWords,

The FCC’s repeal of net neutrality officially [went into effect](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/net-neutrality-repeal-takes-effect-fight-far-over-n881931) earlier this month, but the fight for the free and open Internet is far from over. Congress can still overrule Ajit Pai using a joint resolution under Congressional Review Act (CRA). It already passed the Senate, now we need to force it to a vote in the House.

Today, Internet users from all over the country are travelling in DC to meet face to face with House members and holding local protests. You can [check here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/dc/) to see if there are any protests in your area you can attend today. 

**If you can't make it out to any protests or meetings, but would still like to participate and have your voice heard, you can do either or both of the following:**

- Head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) to write and call your House Representative.

- Call 202-759-7766 to connect to their office. You will likely be connected to a staff member who is happy to take down your comment. You can tell them that you support strong net neutrality rules, and ask them to discharge and vote for the congressional review act (CRA) to reverse the FCC’s repeal.

*Many folks have been asking why threads like this are showing up in unrelated subreddits. Simply put, Reddit wouldn't exist without net neutrality, and losing it permanently is an existential threat to this community and others like it. For that reason, the mods have given us permission to make this post. This thread might not be strictly related to the subreddit, but your freedom to access it absolutely is.*

"tl;dr We want your feedback! [Fill out this form.](https://goo.gl/forms/40OHwSHifiOqh78E3) We're also opening applications for new moderators. Application link within this post.

---

Hello, everyone!

It's been a little while since we've had a regular announcement sticky, eh? Today we have LOTS to talk about.

Recently we hit 500,000 subscribers! That's half a MILLION! If I had a dollar for each subscriber, I could buy 500,000 things at the dollar store, or I could crush my neighbor's house with 50,000,000 pennies (karen just won't stop with the loud music).

Jokes aside, that's a lot- at the beginning of the year we were less than 300K so this is a lot of growth in a little bit of time, so we'd like to get to know you guys a little bit better and see what you'd like to be changed on the subreddit:

2. This one is the big one- we made a feedback form that we'd like everyone to fill out so we know what to change and what to keep. [Here's the link.](https://goo.gl/forms/40OHwSHifiOqh78E3) We'll be sharing these results (all multiple choice, some outtakes from open response) once we hit a decent number of responses to show an appropriate spread.
1. Remember that [discord](https://discord.gg/56nZmBv)? We're always happy to take suggestions through there as well as through [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FMurderedByWords&amp;subject=%2Fr%2FMurderedByWords%20Inquiry). 
3. Or you can just leave a comment on this post. There's no real guarantee that we'll get to you quickly, but I know some of you are pretty lazy.


Feedback is very important to us here, and the moderator team is going to be reading each and every piece of feedback we get. This is *your* community, and we run the community the way that you guys want.

---

*Speaking of the moderation team...*

We need some new moderators! We've been extremely happy with our latest round of recruits, and we're gearing up to add some more people to the team. 

Want to throw your hat in the ring? Enjoy being yelled at through the internet tubes? Okay with getting paid in ""exposure?"" Then you're the right fit for the job!

We're looking for exciting people from all sorts of backgrounds. We want to have a few somewhat-experienced moderators, as well as a few new guys, so everyone should apply if you're interested.

">The symbol of [Richard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Church_of_Fontevraud_Abbey_Richard_I_effigy.jpg)’s military might was the impressive castle of [Château-Gaillard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Ch%C3%A2teau_Gaillard_%28Les_Andelys%29%2C_vu_du_ciel.JPG), on a high cliff above the right bank of the river Seine – the ‘rock of Andelys’ – which he built during 1196, perhaps inspired by the mountain-top stronghold in which he had been incarcerated in Germany, or by the great castles of the Holy Land. Its name meant ‘saucy castle’ and its very existence was an affront, as well as an obstacle, to the French King and his ambitions. It blocked the approaches to Rouen, fairly and squarely.

>[Philip](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Sceau_de_Philippe_Auguste._-_Archives_Nationales_-_SC-D157.jpg) was appalled when he first saw it, but joked bravely, ‘If its walls were made of iron, I would still storm them’.

>Richard’s reply, very much in character, was ‘By God’s throat, if its walls were built of butter, I would still hold them.’

" ""After God had finished the rattlesnake, the toad, and the vampire, he had some awful substance left with which he made a scab.""

""A scab is a two-legged animal with a corkscrew soul, a water brain, a combination backbone of jelly and glue. Where others have hearts, he carries a tumor of rotten principles.""

""When a scab comes down the street, men turn their backs and angels weep in heaven, and the devil shuts the gates of hell to keep him out.""

""No man (or woman) has a right to scab so long as there is a pool of water to drown his carcass in, or a rope long enough to hang his body with. Judas was a gentleman compared with a scab. For betraying his master, he had character enough to hang himself."" A scab has not.

""Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage. Judas sold his Savior for thirty pieces of silver. Benedict Arnold sold his country for a promise of a commission in the British army."" The scab sells his birthright, country, his wife, his children and his fellowmen for an unfulfilled promise from his employer.

Esau was a traitor to himself; Judas was a traitor to his God; Benedict Arnold was a traitor to his country; a scab is a traitor to his God, his country, his family and his class.""",3,1525925139.0,MurderedByWords,8i90hn,15,Ode to a Scab - Jack London (1876 - 1916),https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/8i90hn/ode_to_a_scab_jack_london_1876_1916/

We did it reddit! The vote passed the senate, with the following breakdown:

* 52 for
* 47 against
* 1 abstain

All Democrats voted in favor of this motion, with 3 Republicans supporting it as well \(John Kennedy, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins\)

We still have a **looooong** way to go, though! The next step? Passing the house!

> In his visit with West, the rapper T.I. was stunned to find that West, despite his endorsement of Trump, had never heard of the travel ban. “He don’t know the things that we know because he’s removed himself from society to a point where it don’t reach him,” T.I. said. West calls his struggle the right to be a “free thinker,” and he is, indeed, championing a kind of freedom—a white freedom, freedom without consequence, freedom without criticism, freedom to be proud and ignorant; freedom to profit off a people in one moment and abandon them in the next; a Stand Your Ground freedom, freedom without responsibility, without hard memory; a Monticello without slavery, a Confederate freedom, the freedom of John C. Calhoun, not the freedom of Harriet Tubman, which calls you to risk your own; not the freedom of Nat Turner, which calls you to give even more, but a conqueror’s freedom, freedom of the strong built on antipathy or indifference to the weak, the freedom of rape buttons, pussy grabbers, and fuck you anyway, bitch; freedom of oil and invisible wars, the freedom of suburbs drawn with red lines, the white freedom of Calabasas.",7,1525758161.0,MurderedByWords,8hracq,92,Ta-Nehisi Coates on Kanye West,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/8hracq/tanehisi_coates_on_kanye_west/

"""As his younger co-stars, the actors Garrett Hedlund and Charlie Hunnam, wrestled in the surf like purebred puppies, Affleck, who is forty-five, was photographed wading into the ocean carrying a small red life preserver, running in the shallow waters, and towelling off on the beach. The tattoo—so gargantuan that the bird’s tail found itself dipping below the waistband of Affleck’s blue swim trunks—was plainly visible. In one image, the actor stands alone, looking off into the middle distance. His gut is pooching outward in a way that, in a more enlightened country like, say, France, would perhaps be considered virile, not unlike the lusty Gérard Depardieu in his prime but, in fitness-fascist America, tends to read as Homer Simpsonesque. A blue-gray towel is wrapped protectively around his midsection—recalling a shy teen at the local pool. Staring at the water before him, his gaze obscure and empty, Affleck is a defeated Roman senator, or, perhaps, the most anti-Romantic version imaginable of Caspar David Friedrich’s 1818 “Wanderer in the Sea of Fog.” The image suggests not just the fall of Affleck but the coming fall of man.""

"Hello all, 

I'm an IT guy for a company over in Massachusetts, early this year we got hit really bad by a snow storm. We lost power in the building for around 2 days or so. A group of people where in the plant making sure equipment and product were in good shape, I was here working on the servers which are running on a generator.

The cell towers were not fully working, communicating with the management team was a real challenge. They have asked me to develop a plan for group communications between key people. I suggested we communicate simply with plain group text messages because if cell towers are not fully working, using any application to communicate would be worse as applications use data which may not be a good solution if cell towers are having issues. 

Is plain text message my best option? Is there a different approach you could think of?

I filed a claim through his insurance because the damage to my car is not worth my deductible of $1000. I don’t want to pay it and risk not ever getting the money back.

We had a home that was foreclosed on in 2011.  At the time, there was also a revolving line of credit on the home that went delinquent.  We have spent the years since then recovering from the foreclosure and rebuilding our credit.  Strangely, the foreclosure itself has fallen off of our credit history, but the revolving line of credit is still appearing in a strange way.  For Transunion, the account shows as 'closed' in 2012.  But both Experian and Equifax show the account as 'open', and both show 'last updated' as 6/2018 (June of this year).  Transunion is 'correct', in that the account went delinquent along with the primary mortgage and there has been no activity on the account since then.  

Is there anything that can be done about the account appearing as 'open' with Equifax and Experian?  Is there anything that can be done about 'last updated' activity showing as this year, when there hasn't actually been any activity on the account for over six years?

My wife and I bought a condo in 2007 a bit before the market crash. While we were content living in a two bedroom condo when we had 1 kid we had a second that is the opposite gender. Fast forward a couple of years and had to make a decision: move in with my folks for basically no rent (two family over under setup, basically just need to pay for the increase in utilities, cell phones, food, gas and tax on vehicles, etc) in a town with a much better school system.


Important to note that, even with health insurance, we have had many significant events and non-covered treatments that led to us not having the extra money to throw at the mortgage or save much.


The 3 year plan is to bank as much cash as possible and buy into a 3 or 4 bedroom and have as close to a payment as we currently have.

We have had the condo on the market for 4 months with only 3 showings. We have dropped the price to the point where we are basically covering closing expenses and will walk away with nothing.

First of all I will not accept recommendations of skipping surgery and putting her down. 

My dog got diagnosed with a cancerous tumor and needs it removed.

The surgery and related expenses/medications will be just under $700.

I used my emergency fund on unexpected moving expenses about two months ago, and now I’m stuck financing this bill.  I want to know whether it makes more sense to get a personal loan from my bank or to get a care credit card. 

If I qualify for the care credit card it looks like I can get a promotion for zero interest in which case I’m inclined to do that.

"Backstory: 

I'm 25 years old and recently moved out of my parents house and on my own. (well, with a roomate)

To do this, I left my job and never did anything about the 401K savings I accumulated with my previous job. ($2500)

I took a seasonal position for my current job (risky) and the season is coming to an end. I made decent money working there. $1000 a week before taxes. I will receive a $2000 bonus check in two weeks + my last weeks pay. 

I spent a lot of money moving here, with first + last months rent. My car got total'd so i got a new one. Nothing fancy, a used 2014 ford focus (11k) Making payments on that of $175 a month. Rent is $825 a month. I've now got $6,000 in my account, so after the checks, I should find my way back to around 8k. 

&#x200B;

I have several interviews in the coming days for jobs that pay pretty similarly/more. But if I do not get hired at any of these places, I will go through that 8k in about 4 months. 

If shit hits the fan, which I don't think it will, should I pull my 401k and eat the taxes on it? 

Id imagine that it would be around $1800 give or take after the tax...

"Tl;dr: Should I reduce my 401k contribution while I increase my emergency fund and pay down my low-interest debt?

I have never been very good financially. I have recently gone through a divorce and ended up with $15,000+ in credit card debt. I was living worse than paycheck-to-paycheck, I was putting everything on credit cards, and then paying them off the next month, while still carrying a balance on my other cards. Had I had an interruption in income, I would have been totally screwed and would have been paying a significant amount of extra interest. After about a year of working on my financial situation, I paid all my credit cards (completely) and started getting building a checking account buffer. I’m finally there and have no credit card debt and a one month buffer in my checking account. Now I’m in the process of working on my next financial steps, including an emergency fund and paying off other low-interest debt. I have $37,000 in student loan debt, with a weighted interest rate of 4.1%. I also have an auto loan with a balance of ~$7,800 at 4.75%. I have never cooked, so I have been eating out every meal. I’ve been working to change that by using HelloFresh, but even that is expense since I’m a single guy. My income is significant (base salary is $115,000), but I barely “bring home” more than half. My normal net pay is ~$5,000.00 a month. My monthly expenses break down as:

Rent: $1,608  
Utilities: $125  
Internet: $70  
Auto Loan: $399  
Television: $110 (I am planning to kind of cut the cord to reduce this to $50 or less a month)  
Cell Phone: $0 (work pays for my cell phone)  
Gym: $150  
Student Loans: $403  
Food: $750 (groceries and eating out are included)  
Side Business Expenses: $50  
Auto Insurance: $130  
Gas: $150  
Pet Expenses: $150  
  
My annual expenses are:  
Auto Maintenance, Taxes, Registration: $1000  
Side Business Expenses: $475  
Renter’s Insurance: $180  

I’ve been working to really solidify my budget using YNAB, but I’m not sure I’m in love with it yet…so recommendations there would also be appreciated.

You may ask how is it possible to only bring home ~$65,000 a year from a job that pays almost twice that. Well, there are two reasons: one, I have a very high retirement contribution (12% employee/3% employer match) and two, I have a huge FSA contribution ($200/paycheck) because I started this job mid-year. This pays for both my braces and mental health care that is rather expensive. Next year, I will have a significantly smaller FSA contribution ($70/paycheck) as I will have barely anything left on my braces. 

I think that a safe emergency fund would be $18,000. My plan currently is to put $500/month into my Ally savings account automatically each month, which would get me there after 3 years of no additional contributions. Anything I have left over at the end of the month also gets transferred to the savings account. Each quarter I get paid a bonus based on my quota at work (but I don't have much control over whether I hit my number or not), and I also budget without accounting for my “third paycheck” that happens twice a year. My plan is to send both of those straight to my savings account as well as any income I make from my small side business. 

I think my question really comes down to whether I should reduce my 401k contribution while I increase my emergency fund and pay down my low-interest debt. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

My mom used AT&T's Digital Life service over a year ago. When it was first installed it didn't work, so they had it all removed. They tried to charge a ton of fees for her cancellation, but she argued and fought and ended up only paying $200 to cancel everything.

She calls the collection agency and finds out it's from AT&T. Turns out AT&T decided after her cancellation that the $200 she paid wasn't going to cut it. She was never notified of this. So now it has been sitting and piling up late fees and its turned into this whole huge thing. 

She's been on the phone with AT&T for the last four hours, has been transferred 12 times to the same two departments, and what she found out in that time was that the supervisor that had initially authorized her $200 cancellation fee is no longer with the company so I guess they ""changed their minds"". Finally when the went to transfer her yet again, she ended up being transferred to the collection agency. She's been on the phone with them for a while and the least they will settle for is $450.

"I’m 26 and recently got a sysadmin job. For background, I graduated community college with an AAS in telecom in 2012 and have been working full time in IT ever since. Overall, my financial situation has been pretty good. I don’t have any loans or debts and have very good credit. I pay off my credit card bill every month and live pretty frugally, oftentimes having a little more money at the end of the month once everything is paid. 

I’m contemplating going back to school for my BS sometime in the next year or two (I’m working on some unrelated personal goals first). However, I’m concerned about having to take out student loans and how much time it would take me to finish. I don’t have a good relationship with my parents, so maintaining a decent credit score and financial independence is most important to me. Also, my high school had a program where you could take CC courses during senior year if you had an A average, and I graduated at the top of my class so the state paid for the rest of my CC courses. Therefore, I have absolutely no experience with tuition/loans and I don’t want to be saddled with debt. 

In addition, since I graduated with my Associates degree 6 years ago, I’m assuming most of the credits will have expired and I’d have to re-take all those courses.

I’ve done a bit of research and it seems like Western Governors University and Thomas Edison State University would be my top two choices for online college since they seem to be less expensive and you can test out of courses if you already know the material. However, apparently there’s stigma against online colleges amongst HR/hiring managers and they only respect B&amp;amp;M schools. 

So my questions are:

- since I’m spending the time and money, is it better to get a degree from a B&amp;amp;M school with an online program, or would a degree from an accredited online college like WGU/TESU be accepted by HR departments?

- should I use my savings/cash out my pension from my old job to pay tuition out of pocket (I could probably afford to do it but it would be a huge dent in my savings/old pension) or take out loans?

- for context, most sysadmin job postings will specify “Bachelor’s preferred, or an equivalent combination of education and experience”, so it’s hotly debated amongst us in the industry as to how necessary a degree is. Usually for management positions (managing the people in the IT department) it’s necessary to have a Bachelor’s or higher, but there’s plenty of people with HS diplomas or Associates degrees working on the technical side. Currently, I have no interest in managing people in an IT department, so is it more prudent for me to stay financially safe by not going back to school and incurring all the debt and expense?",4,1537246231.0,personalfinance,9go6gf,1,"I work full time as a sysadmin, thinking of getting my BS degree in IT.

"Hey all,

&#x200B;

Throwaway account here, recently hired on for a new job, making close to 2x what I am making now. My family and I have always lived paycheck to paycheck, maxed out CC, etc, and I want to break that cycle with this new position. Here are my thoughts so far, can I get some insight, possible barriers, etc? TIA

1. Pay off all CC debt
2. Create new savings accounts (General, car maintence/payment, Bills, childs college fundand vacation)
   1. Want to pay down our cars so we are no longer underwater on them
   2. I am a member of USAA, and another credit union. Should I be using the CU for saving as well?
   3. Any ideas on better Savings accounts for kids college fund (he's 3)
3. 401k is non matched, should I leave that out of the equation?
4. Once all this is done, get started in traditional investments (this should be interesting)
   1. Currently have money in Bitcoin from years ago that is worth low 5 figures, intend to replace what I have had to remove to pay bills and so forth.
5. ???

Rough outline here, if I am way off base/need more info, please let me know, and I will be happy to oblige!

"My SO and I are looking to buy our first house and have found something that has a lot of potential.  It is a small Cape Cod style house in a great location, right on the river, with a decently sized yard and an in-ground pool (which has been out of use for a long time and would need to be redone from the bottom up).  We love how small and cozy it is, but we are both worried about the not-so-small detail of it being a short sale home.  As we have both rented our entire lives, things like this are a bit Greek to us and I would be a liar if we weren't extremely nervous about what exactly that will mean going forward.

&#x200B;

The property manager (who is different from BOTH the owner and the landlord) has told us that it is ready for immediate move-in, even though it probably wouldn't close immediately.  He has given us the option to \*rent\* the home in the meantime.  Is this normal?  None of our family or close friends have any experience dealing with short sales, and we want to make sure this isn't a too-good-to-be-true situation.  My fear is that we will lock ourselves into renting this house (which is going to drive up its appraisal since we will be improving it), which will give them 0 reason to close on the house.

I spoke to an LC rep about this year's poor returns and he explained that they're due to the nature of fixed loan payments: early in the life of a loan most of each payment is interest, but near the end of the loan it's mostly principal. He said this leads to lower returns when notes are close to maturity.

Q: Does this make any sense? At the start of the loan I lend $50. If each payment is $1, what do I care how much is principal and how much is interest? It's $1 going back into my account whether it's P or I.

His cyclical explanation also doesn't explain why I haven't seen this before, although I muddied the waters by adding significant funds every year or two at first, which might mask this effect (if it's a real effect).

Hi,

I got adopted and brought to the U.S when I was young. I'm on the autistic spectrum and I'm relatively high functioning although I have been extremely sheltered and not really familiar with the outside world. I didn't venture outside the house till about 6 years ago. During the first 2 years, people were constantly approaching me to join some kind of MLM or pyramid scheme. Although I never gave in, such interactions did reveal how naive I was. I'm 30 now.

To my great surprise, I developed this skill being able to connect with other humans and got into sales. I sold mattresses and furniture and I got about $8000 saved up in a checking account.

I have no car. I don't know how to drive.
I have no rental history. I always stayed with family.
I don't have any real friends, though I'm good at making superficial conversations that are good for ""sales"", I'm very much an introvert and being on the spectrum, I prefer mostly to be alone and actively avoid collecting ""Friends"". I don't have a lot in common with many.
I don't watch TV.
I don't watch the news. I frankly don't know anything about politics or sports or movies or current world events at large.
I'm not on social media. 

I'm getting kicked out. I don't really know the steps in front of me. 
Should I rent a room? 
I'm in Vancouver, WA ( not Canada ) and property and rent have gone way up. I would deplete my savings in a couple of months.  
Unfortunately, all my work experience and work ( selling mattresses and furniture ) was at a family store and I won't be able to work there anymore. 
I could apply to other furniture stores in the area but such stores seems to be hi in this area right now. 

I don't have many of the basic skills that most humans have like driving. I'm not mechanical. I may be high functioning but people did used to call me retarded all the time just to give you an idea of how others perceive me.  I need help from some compassionate souls to help me guide where to go next with my life. My mind does things it already knows. So if it doesn't already know something, it doesn't do! So not knowing any blocks in front of me, I feel unable to move. 

**Where to stay:** The nearest motel costs $75. I guess I could stay there a night or two. Should I invest in a tent and go into the bushes? 
I could look at Craigslist for roommate situations but having no rental history, I'm not sure how that works out. I also have something else going against me. I wish I didn't have to say this but it's the nature of the world we find ourselves now - my skin color is brown. People naturally seem to be afraid of me. 

**Where to work:** I have no skills that I'm aware of except ""talking to people"". I can make people comfortable for a short while. The kind of small talk and laughter that would be good in *sales.* I do think outside the box as it's impossible for me to see the box. My greatest asset is my mind. I have no manual labor skills but I'm willing to try anything to survive. I would be just really bad at it. No repair or mechanical skills. 

**Changing Phone:** I'm on a T-mobile business plan from work. I need to get my own phone number and join a plan. What kind of monthly payments am I looking at to getting my own number? Do I just walk into a T-mobile store and just ask? Do I need to bring any documentations? = Such questions gives you and idea of how unfamiliar I'm with the outside world.

**My strength:** My will. I don't know how to give up. I will keep getting back up and walk towards that door that I believe in. This time, I don't see any doors in front of me. Point me in the direction and I will go all in. 

I'm at a Starbucks right now. Been here for like 3 hours. I'm going to leave to find some nourishment but I will watch and respond to any replies when I get the chance to have wifi. Thank you.

I’ve done this for years and I’ve never had any problems, until this afternoon. I was feeling much more jittery than normal, and I couldn’t sit still. I was breathing heavily and could feel my heart racing, so I had to leave work to go home and rest. While I was driving home, my left arm goes almost completely numb, followed by my right arm. I have never felt anything like this before in my life, so I did the logical thing: I pulled over and called 911, thinking I was having a heart attack.

When the paramedics arrive, they conclude that I while my heart rate was elevated, I wasn’t having a heart attack, but a panic attack. FUCK.

I refused treatment and a hospital visit, and made damn sure to mark it as such on their digital pad when they asked for my signature. I asked for a receipt of this medical transaction, and they gave me a card with a number on it to call to get it. Again, I didn’t go to the hospital or get an ambulance ride. They did a quick checkup on me in the back of the ambulance on the side of the road, and I went on with my day.

Some facts about me:

- I make $27,000/year (Live in North Carolina, work in South Carolina) at my main job. I work a weekend job at a restaurant making <$500/mo to pay for my online coding boot camp.

- I signed up for health insurance this past Friday 9/14, but haven’t yet received my health insurance card. Insurance provider is Aetna.

- I am 25-years-old man, no previous major health issues. Never took prescription meds, no previous heart-related problems, etc. Hell, I’ve never even broken a bone.


Here’s the breakdown of my bills:

- Rent: $457/mo, utilities included.

- Car payment: $125/mo 

- Car insurance: $270/mo (two at-fault accidents, insured with USAA)

- Groceries: $150-200/mo 

- Education: $199/mo (web development boot camp)

- Gas: $35/week, $140/mo 

- Health Insurance: $44/mo (taken out of paycheck)

However if the value goes up if we get acquired at some point...even from $0.40 -> $1.00 would double my investment.

"I'm currently 21, and I opened at 401k account as soon as my company would let me when I turned 21.  It's been almost exactly a year since, and I've only placed in about $4.4k.  I make about ~58k while going part time for an engineering degree, and I live with my parents who were insanely generous in letting me stay rent free until I finish my 4 year (2 more years left).  My company provides an HSA w/ 750$ deposit every year which I have opened, but haven't actually deposited any of my own money into.  They also provide Empower 401k, that they match .75 up to 5%.  I've been depositing 7% and I'm currently allocating 100% to [Vanguard Target Retirement 2055](https://awrd.morningstar.com/SBT/Tools/MR/Default.aspx?fullversion=1&ticker=VFFVX).  My current expenses are university which I'm paying out of pocket ~$12k a year, a few bills I help cover for my parents, and car maintenance/insurance.  I have about 35k in savings that's just sitting there being eaten up by inflation, I'm planning on moving it to a high-yield OS account sometime next week.

I believe that 4.4k in a year is pretty meager given the golden opportunity I'm given right now to save/invest.  I'm just looking for general advice on a few things:


-Should I focus on maxing out my HSA first?  Can HSA savings be invested similar to how a 401k is invested?

-I've noticed that empower charges me about 11$ every month for a 'Participant Account Maintenance' fee.  Should I open a personal traditional IRA after maxing out my employer contribution at 5%?

-How much of my money should I be putting into retirement vs. saving for a house?  My folks are from the USSR, so they're not completely sold on the idea that 401k will even last my lifetime, and recommend that I should just save towards real estate instead.

-Should I do anything with my current savings?  I likely won't touch them for another 2 years.

"If I understand correctly, the dollar amount of Social Security tax is independent of the choice between traditional or Roth retirement savings.

1. Social Security and Medicare taxes (as a %)
2. Traditional 401k and IRA, HSA (as a flat amount); Health, disability, unemployment, etc. insurances (as a flat amount); other things like Wageworks

"Mid-twenties couple here. We live in a moderate state in terms of living costs. Fiancé’s parents purchased a home outright for her to the tune of $380,000 and it’s appreciating quickly. She has several million set up for her in trusts; we plan on not touching that at all until we have kids. We both own our cars, have no loans.

She is going for her master’s and I am self employed. I bring in about $110,000. I don’t have much experience investing. I tried stocks a few years ago and got my clock cleaned. 

What I’m curious about is whether we should leverage the home via HELOC in order to purchase an apartment as investment property or if we’d set ourselves up better for the future by just investing for the 6% yearly return. Fiancé really loves interior design, so she’s completely set on purchasing an apartment as an investment, renovating and then renting. By my calculations, we would be able to profit around $600/mo conservatively with renting the apartment and paying the HELOC payment and insurances for both properties every month. Our metropolitan area is booming and has been for several years. Apartments are a hot commodity and are renting at huge rates. 

I know this sub tends to shy away from property as an investment and I understand the market is really hot right now and will slow down. We wouldn’t be making any moves for a few years.

"Hi there,

I'm buying my first home. I live in a tourist destination and am considering buying a home with a finished walk-out basement for the purpose of renting the basement on Airbnb and living in the upper level. The price for this type of home is $270-290k, whereas a comprable home without the basement is $220-240k. The difference is $50k, or a $262/month increase to my mortgage on a 30 year loan at 4.8% interest. 

I'm putting $100k down either way, and can afford the mortgage on either house.

I estimate making approximately $550/month income minimum after fees and expenses on the AirBnB rental at 1/2 occupancy. 

Raising my mortgage by $262/month to make $550 seems like a sound investment and I would enjoy running it. However, I'm looking for things I may have missed or potential pitfalls. 

Hopefully someone has similar experience or advice.

So I have been having difficulty trying to understand how to tackle my student loans. Here is the breakdown below:

I gathered student loans throughout undergrad and grad school, and I currently work as a musician. I have been out of school for about 4 years now, and have been on a payment plan of $x/month that increases slowly every year until I reach the age of 52 (currently 28) and the loans are fully paid off. The breakdown of my loans is as follows:

$5k at 6.5%

$10k at 5.5%

$25k at 4.5%

$20k at 4%

Until recently, I did not think much about my loans and made the monthly payments, but recently realized that for the past 4 years my monthly payments have only been going towards paying interest, and that my interest has been increasing this whole time! So in short, I have paid around $11k towards my loans to date, and my current total loan amount is more than I started with!

Due to my income and nature of my work (not a W2 employee for an orchestra or company), I have been having trouble finding anyone that can refinance these loans. So my current strategy has been to pay as much as I can towards these loans each month over the minimum payment. I am reaching out to this community because I trust the advice here. Any ideas or advice for how to tackle these loans, potential companies that refinance for musicians, or any other ideas?

"Okay, so this actually my fist post on Reddit, let alone first post in this thread. I'm a literal newbie to both Financials and Reddit. A lot of you guys seem to have pretty sound advice, so I thought I'd give it a try.

So first off, currently 22 yrs old, $18/hr gross salary $35,000 and up for raise again early next year, most likely to $19-20/hr in addition to room for further promotion. Finished an Associates with no debt, working on bachelors with most likely $20,000-$30,000 in debt when I'm done. Will have two bachelors, several language certificates and the like, and plan to get masters as well. So I should have decent job prospects in the future.

Only have about $2000 in savings.

Currently have approx $7576 in  total debt, which I am currently trying to pay off before I will be responsible for paying my loans. One of these credit cards is under my name, but is not my usage. One of my parents is buying with and paying off that card. The others have accumulated through helping family members with emergencies, which I have been unable to completely pay off.

Currently don't own a car, but do pay rent-- though it is much lower thanks to still living with my parents and commuting.

"I'm trying to get approved for a card (discover IT) with slightly better rewards than I have now (capital one journey). When I applied, their main reason for declining me seemed to be that I have several recent inquiries (from getting my current card and from applying to rent at a few places). The other reason was high utilization. My card is only 500 limit right now, so I was just putting gas and groceries and a couple bills on it and it hit 400 this month lol. I have the cash to pay it off and do so every month, but I guess it looks bad. 

I have two accounts that went to collections and were paid from two years ago about 150 bucks each. I also have 10k in deferred student loans across four accounts. Income is 40k with 350 rent a month.

How long until all those inquiries stop mattering? Should I just wait until then, keep my utilization low that month, and apply then?  It feels to me like I'm getting screwed with that 500 limit, which is scheduled to increase in 4 months.

"My wife joined a boxing type gym with a credit card.  She lost the credit card at some point and someone made fraudulent charges with it.  We had to call the bank to tell them with charges were fraudulent.  My bank mistakenly thought the gym membership was a fraud charge and long story short, the gym charged us twice and our statement shows we definitely paid twice.

The problem is obviously we shouldn't have to pay twice, BUT the owner says their payment processor only got paid ONCE.  I believe him as he's a nice guy and we were on good terms with him, so I called my Bank to dispute the charges as it's nothing we can handle.

The wife also ended up canceling our membership a month or so later.

The bank refunded us right away, and about a month later emailed us to say the dispute has been settled.

I thought all was said and good but then my wife keeps getting emails that states we owe them money.

We emailed and it's the same story.  His payment processor keeps saying they only received payment once, and is asking me to tell my bank to provide proof we paid twice (but i mean i figure the dispute department would take care of all that..). 

I feel bad for the guy but I can't pay him an extra payment we dont owe him just cus we feel bad for him.

So this leaves me to my question.. he did mentioned he canceled her membership.  BUT we still keep getting emails that she owes them money.

"Hi!

My S/O and I are looking into getting a modular home. We have the land, a well, a septic tank, and electricity on site, but we are looking at about $200,000 for the house we like, leaving us around a $1,000/mo mortgage. My uncle, whose health is not great, will be living with us. Combined, we have a monthly **net** income of $5,187. 

Hopefully, my income will be going up significantly soon as I just completed a graduate degree and have been applying and interviewing for other, high-paying jobs.

So... I have a few questions.

1. Is it better for me to stay in my current job since I've been here for 3 years as I am attempting to get a mortgage or would it be better to be in a higher-income job when I try?
2. My credit is currently around 641. From the looks of it, I won't be able to borrow much. My uncle, however, is around a 750. The guy we talked to at one of the modular places told  me that I would no need a co-signer. Would I?
3. How do I prove that all of these incomes will be contributing to the mortgage if the house is only in my name?
4. Would FHA be the best option? Or perhaps a special construction loan?

I'm planning on graduating Spring 2020. I'll have $11,000 of student loan debt (federal unsubsidized) - most of it from my first attempt at college when I was 18.

Questions: When I was 18 I had a nice internship that netted me $10,000, but events in my life caused be to withdraw basically all of it a few months later. This was 2015. In Spring of 2016 I got a notice from my bank (BoA) saying they are closing my account (which had <$200 at the time and I hadn't made a deposit or withdrawal in several months after the big withdrawal). This past month I opened up a TD Ameritrade account and put $100 in it at the time of account creation, and bought 2 stocks. 2 weeks later (last week), I received a notice that they are closing my account.

"Without going into too much confusing details, I've had a rough upbringing and a rough last 6 months or so.

I was living with my grandparents and was attending college full time and working (this is in Georgia). My grandfather's mental state was quickly getting worse, he was getting violent, my grandmother was getting overwhelmed, and basically I had to leave. I felt I overstayed my welcome anyways. 

There was a family emergency up north and other personal things going on so I moved to another state and moved in with my disabled mother. It was a very abusive, toxic environment and on top of that, I could not find a job and my mother was stealing my money. My health issues and my mental state quickly deteriorated and I was convinced to go on welfare until I could figure out what to do. I basically had nothing.

I was there for approx 4 months until I decided I had to do something different. I used the welfare benefits I was getting to my advantage and was getting help for the health issue I was having as well as therapy for everything that was going on.

I got in touch with an old friend and moved back to my home town in Georgia just last week and am looking into jobs and am doing well. 

My concerns is, will being previously on welfare affect me negatively in anyway moving forward? I was getting financial aid for school before I moved but I did not return this present fall semester since I moved, but I want to go back next spring and continue working on my degree. But Since I had a change of address, quit my job, got on government assistance, that has obviously changed my income and residency situation a lot.

Also, will it affect me getting a job? I've noticed on job applications that I've had to put down if I got any assistance, what exactly do they look into that for? Will they look down upon me for this or will it ruin my chances of getting a job?

Is there anything else important I need to know? I didn't know anything about welfare or what it was before I went on it and am kind of ashamed of having been on it. 

TLDR; I had to leave my hometown where I was working and going to school. I had to move in with disabled mother which turned out to be a toxic environment and I ended up on welfare as I couldn't find a job.

2) pay off some debt on the CC - My payments for the cc come to about $1300/month right now if I want to pay it off in full by March.

"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here. My wife 30F and myself 28M were raised by financially ignorant families. We knew we wanted financial security bc growing up in poor mindset families was very hard on us as children. When my wife and I met seven years ago we had a negative net worth of $100K. Today, we have roughly a net worth of $100K+. I have my MBA and my wife has her bachelors. We make about $130K a year (before tax) and we live in the midwest. We have one child who is two who attends day care that costs about $1,200 a month. (average rate for our area) We plan to have one more child in late 2019 if everything works out. So daycare will be roughly $2,400 a month for 2020 - 2023. We need some help on what to do now with our money. No one we know has been in a situation close to the one we are in so we are in uncharted financial territory. We are looking for answers or insight into what to do next with our money. Below is a breakdown of our financial situation. Our goal is to retire at age 55 and 57 or before.

Should we continue to invest or payoff debt? How should we invest? We are currently maxing out HSA -> Roth IRA -> what's left goes to our Roth 401K. If we should payoff debt which ones and how aggressive? We are not paying any additional payments to debt currently.

Cash: $20K

Credit cards: $30K (Basically, my wife's mother stole her identity from age 18 to 25. She lost her source of income and was living off them. We have a good relationship with her but she is a fool with money. She was confronted with this about 5 years ago and swears she'll pay them off. We're not idiots and know that one day this will be our burden. In the meantime she's paying the minimums on them. We monitor all the credit cards to ensure everything is being paid.)

Student Loans: $37K with a blended rate of about 4.6% before considering the tax benefits.

Car loan: $13K the rates 3%. Blue book for the car is around $16K it's a 2015 Kia Sorento.

Mortgage Primary res: $256K the rate is 4.625%. Worth about $275Kish. (We just bought this two months ago).

Mortgage Investment property: $159K the rate is 5.3%. Appraised at $212K three months ago. (Our first home. I put a lot of sweat equity into this). I am renting this out for $1,700 per month. The mortgage is $1,200 per month.

Investments:

Roth IRAs: $40K (Invested in comm free ETFs.)

Trad IRAs: $15.5K (Invested in comm free ETFs.)

Roth 401Ks: $28K (Invested in comm free ETFs.)

HSA: $13K (Invested in comm free ETFs.)

"My grandma bought a condo in 1994, refinanced or did a second mortgage, I’m not sure as I was just a child but in early 2016 she moved out of state and I took her mortgage over. She just started paying on the original mortgage a year or two before she moved so I’m thinking she had a second mortgage to pay legal fees when I was younger. 

Mortgage $390/month 3.5% interest 15 year loan with ~11 years left
HOA $206/month

I’m not a huge fan of where I live and I hate paying so much in HOA fees when there’s nothing but a pool open for the summer and half assed snow removal in the winter + trash removal twice a week. 

Everything is still in my grandmas name but I pay insurance/taxes and no issues when I go to sell down the road. Will probably add my name to the deed in another few years once I get some of my student loans and other small debts out of the way first. 

What’s my best option to get this paid down quicker than 11 years? How many extra payments would we have to make each year to maybe cut the mortgage term by a third or half? My fiancé and I would like to sell in about 5 to 6 years, before our daughter starts school as the school district here is subpar. Right now I owe around $38k and I think another unit sold around the higher end of 50k. My neighbor is a realtor and mentioned that the units are selling for a good amount of money.

"Short of things is my MiL passed away last year, my Wife has an inherited IRA that requires RMDs.  We are both 30 years old as of today. The 2018 RMD is going to be \~$5,500.  This amount goes up \~5% per year until we're 70.  Our plan was always to just take this and roll it into an IRA/Brokerage and pretend it doesn't exist.  

&#x200B;

Assuming our annual salaries keep increasing year-over-year, and the RMD keeps increasing we'll slowly break into larger and larger tax brackets from this... so more and more of this will go to taxes, and less to us.

&#x200B;

My assumption is that we're better off taking more than the RMD early to fill up Roth IRAs to let this stuff grow there as long as possible and be tax free later.  Taking the edge off a large RMD tax hit later in life by fueling Roth IRAs early.

"Its almost been 5 years I am out of University. I started working early while I was studying. In these years I read about,

1. Early retirement - You make so much money early in your career that you can take retirement and you will never need to work.
2. Financial Independence - You reach a point where you don't need to work anymore.
3. Investing early: You start investing very early in your career and when you are old, it turns into a good amount of money.

This all excited me. I lived very frugally for the first few years, paid all my education debt, saved enough money, bought a car, made a year long emergency fund. I think some part of this personal finance things people keep focusing on have flows,

1. If you retire early, its not as cool as you think. I read about people that retired early, lived low cost but still ran out of money. And when you are old and you run out of money, you don't have any choice. A smarter choice is to keep your head down and keep working. If you need to take a break, take a break but once you are out of work, its hard to get back in again. **You die**.
2. Financial independence is both good and bad. It does set you free from the everyday struggle to work but on the other hand it takes away your drive to work hard and beat yourself to make more money. In this case, your **drive** dies.
3. Investing early: I kept playing from the finance side (I am an engineer by profession). I think it was a good choice but an even better choice is **investing in yourself**. You are the asset you should focus on investing time and money on first and foremost.

Some good things I did,

1. Have an emergency fund (atleast 3 months expenses). Good if you have a year long expenses saved.
2. Invest in stuff that matters. Like I am a programmer and I invested in a good laptop, a bed, mattress, good chair, good keyboard, a fine car that doesn't need much maintenance.
3. Lived pretty frugally have some cash saved.

"Hi folks,

I've relocated to US last year with my employer and now my wife started to work as well.

We both work in Healthcare companies and wife and kids are under my health insurance. Now my wife's employer is offering health insurance as well and I was thinking her to opt out of her plan or not?

My Healthcare insurance is one of the best in US (according to colleagues)
My wife's plan with new wmployer is similar but mine is better with dental and vision more comprehensive.

We are both healthy and kids are fine as well we don't have any pre-existing conditions.

Is there an advantage to have both of us carry health insurance plans from our employers? If she opts out she get 50$ a month and I don't have a penalty if she is employed.

Also I have an HSA that I haven't touched but it is I believe for family and not for person. Am I correct? What do you do with the HSA? Can I put it in an investment account? 

For the dependant care fsa: we have kids in daycare and I'm using it for daycare expenses but I believe this is for family as well so we can't have both?

"I have a Capital One MasterCard with a $4500 limit. I am 28 and make around $55k per year and that is my only credit card. I also have a great deal of student debt which is where a good amount of my monthly income goes.

Anyways, due to switching jobs and changing tax brackets in 2016, I owed the IRS $4,000 which I paid off from April 2017 until January of 2018. I paid it off successfully, but it required me to live largely off my credit card which ran up the balance. Now, I am able to pay off around $2200 per month on my credit card, but I have watched my balance snowball from around $2800 when I started trying to eliminate that debt in January to $3600 this month. This month, too, I have $500 committed to a friend’s wedding and can only pay $1700 towards that $3600.

I feel like it is silly to try and pay this debt off while being charged credit card interest rates. However, what is my best option to “refinance?” My credit score is fairly high. I have received offers from other banks to let me transfer the balance onto another card and pay no interest for 12 months. Is that a good option? Would it be better to get a personal loan and pay back a bank over the next year at a lower interest rate? Is there another option I am not thinking of?

"In 2016, my fiancee left her job at a dentist office. She had a 401k, which she rolled over to an IRA in March 2017. Last week, she got a statement from her old 401k, with updates to the fees and conditions, etc. Surprised to be getting anything from the old 401k, she called her previous employer (the dentist office). They said they contributed $1,000 to her 401k in March 2018 as part of their profit sharing program. These profits were from 2016 when she still worked there.

This seems very odd to us, as we expected the old 401k account to be fully closed. Does this make any sense? If this seems legit, her plan would be to roll over the $1,000 to her current 401k.

"I live in Los Angeles which is known for having very high prices on homes, but I currently have an opportunity to potentially buy one with my mom. The current scenario that we're exploring is that she (unemployed/semi-retired) could put down a large down payment ($300k) and I could fill in the rest ($300k loan, based off of a $110k gross salary) for a house around $600k. From there, we'd share the house and when it comes time to move or selling it, she'd get back her down plus half the equity on the sale.

To me it sounds like a good opportunity to explore, but I'm tentative about a few things: the commute (we're looking at the valley, and I currently work/live in Santa Monica) being number one, and if the terms of how we're splitting the costs feel fair. On the flipside, I'm also apprehensive because if we don't end up buying a home together she's going to find a smaller place on her own which means that I'd be missing out on an opportunity to own a home and make some money which could help on a future solo purchase (or, potentially keep a home for the long term).

"Hi guys,

Recently i've been researching ways to improve my credit score. I don't have a bad credit score, but why not try to improve it.

One of the things that I found is to pay off credit cards in full every month (utilization 0%). However, say my credit score drops because my utilization goes from 0% to 20%. If I pay it off the next month, won't my credit score go back to where it was last month?

What i am trying to understand is the length of the effect utilization has on my credit score. I know that a missed payment can set you back for a few years, but what about not paying your credit card in full every month? Keeping it under 30% though.

I know that I would have to pay interests, but thats not with i am concerned about.

"Okay PF, first time posting in here, I've been lurking in your budget wiki for quite a while now, and I think this subreddit does some truly helpful work. Work that changes peoples whole lives and gives them confidence and freedom when it comes to their personal finances. With that in mind I've come to you all for help with my next step, buying a home

So, to start off, let me list out some things for you:

* 23 years old male
* 0 dependent single filing, will be planning to live with my girlfriend throughout this
* Midwest, Nebraska to be specific
* My Yearly income, around 31K before tax, 27K after
 
Okay, so my **current situation** is that I'm working at an industrial production plant full time, renting out the basement of my parents house, and my girlfriend lives with me. I have a 2000 GMC sierra and she has a 2010 Dodge avenger, both fully owned by us. The avenger is less than 100K miles and runs fine. The truck is at 181K and is starting to show signs of its age, but is still reliable and should stay reliable for another 2-3 years.

I work operations at an industrial plant and take classes part time at a local community college for engineering, she is working retail (9.50/hr) while getting CNA classes done. I've been looking for houses for about two years, with it becoming serious about six months ago.

My **end game goal** is to have land. Something around 4 acres, with a decent off-grid 200amp house and an above decent garage/work building. My **current goal** is a house, 1 car garage, heat/ac of some kind, 100amp or more service, and room for my kind of lifestyle. My lifestyle is a very midwest style. I like to tinker, I do my own maintenance, I will leave saw horses in the yard over the weekend, I will use loud equipment, and I like my space. This does not mean I won't live in an apartment and do these things where I can, but that would be extremely unwanted.

So, **the land**. It is one narrow lot, 1.5 acres, split into two fenced areas. There is a very interesting building in the back lot, about 25'X10', along with a few that are not worth keeping upright. It is wire fence with wood post, and goes around the entire back lot and half of the front lot. The back lot is just dirt and grass, and the front is the same with a few more trees to keep sound down from the highway. It has a well on site, with a pump room in the garage, septic in the back lot. 100amp or more service. **It is located in a flood plain.**

Now, **the house**. It is a 3 bed, 2 bath, 1400 square foot home built in 1974, a 2 car garage, and a connector building/hallway in between. The garage is very decent, two bay doors, with room to pull in two cars on each side. It has a small pump room for well water in the back. The connector building has washer/dryer hookups, water heater, and is fully roofed/insulated/it's an addition from the house to the garage, it's just narrow. The house itself has an a/c unit, uses propane for heating, very large front deck with newerish roof, and... It's a permanent set double wide trailer. It was a foreclosure, I spoke with the neighbor and she said the owner moved to Arizona, it has been vacant from Oct. 2017 (winterized by lending company at the time after found vacant) The house is listed for $37,000.

**Math and logic**

I see this as a great opportunity for someone like me. Using YNAB and PFs advice, I've got my current expenses budgeted and have room for another 650/month, which is what I would expect the mortgage payment, insurance (home, flood, and less than 20% down payment so mortgage as well), and other monthly costs to be. 

My logic for this kind of house (a cheap one that won't sell for anything real, ever.) is that, in my head, if the TOTAL cost of renting an apartment for 5 years in town is more than the TOTAL cost of this house for 5 years, buying the house is the better option in the scope of overall cash cost. 

Another reason I like this idea is that a 40K house on 1.5 acres is still small enough that if I do have an upset (scenario I owe 40K~ in debt) it is not the end of the world and can be paid down relatively fast. I am not planning for failure, but I feel it is important to feel security in the knowledge that this would not be a game ending decision if it went south. 

I have no problem with the stigma attached to manufactured homes, as I've never cared much what other people think about me, and to me, a house is a house as long as it's sealed and livable it counts.

**Questions and advice**

1. Am I right in thinking that, as long as total cost is less, it is usually a better option financially to purchase a house than to rent for the same price over 5 years?


2. Is there a good comparison of well water/septic vs city water/sewage? (info graphic or in depth article of some sort)

3. I do not know much about manufactured homes and am not sure how different upkeep is on them. Is there a guide/article about maintenance and information specific to manufactured homes?

4. As a first time home buyer, with it being such a unique one at that, I'm sure there are many things I need to look at and identify. I'm not sure how old 1974 is for a manufactured home. I do not know much about propane/well/septic and the costs associated vs. NG/city/sewage. I'm unsure of what restrictions there are maintenance and upgrade wise due to it being a manufactured home. Any information, anecdotal or article, would be helpful.

"Hi all, 

This is my first time posting here and I’ve got an issue I’ve been sitting on for awhile and figured I’d ask for advice. 

I’m a 22 year old college student finishing up my junior year of college. I went the smart route and did 2 yrs at a county school and then transferred over to a low cost university. I’ll probably end up graduating with around 40k in debt which doesn’t sound terrible to me. 

I honestly don’t make much at all where I am now (around 10 an hour),but it’s hard to find a job willing to accommodate a full time student commuting schedule wise. I am actively looking for jobs but it’s definitely hard to find a major-specific job that doesn’t require full time hours. 

That being said, basically right now I have about 2500 dollars in my savings account, and about 850-900 left on my one credit card. I want to add money into my savings each paycheck and grow it but it’s been hard with my credit card payments each month as I’ve been making 50-100 dollar payments. 

Would it be smart of me to just pay off my credit card with my savings, and then using the money I would be putting on my credit card bill, I can put that back into my savings? 

The interest isn’t too insane, but it does add up and I feel like I’ve been stuck in a never ending cycle of paying then being forced to use it and so I feel the amount just isn’t going down. 

Any advice in general would be greatly appreciated.

I understand I can be perceived as a leech, but my mental health has deteriorated significantly over the past year. Anyway, my parents have been extremely generous to me and paid for my apartment rent and other expenditures for the first 8 months of 2018 (4 months in college and 4 months out of college). I lived at home for the past month and have just moved into an apartment with a roommate. My parents are now switching to give me an allowance ($1,500) a month until I can support myself. They are in the top tax bracket (i.e. 39.6% income tax / 20% capital gains tax).

I am deciding whether or not to sell my assets in order to sustain myself in a more comfortable manner until I can understand what is happening to me.

After a bit of run around, I took it to a shop and they found the problem to be the valve cover gasket had caused oil to leak all over the spark plugs, the timing belt, and an engine mount had broken.

Well flash forward a bit, I got the car fixed, ran perfectly until this past Friday when the check engine light came on as I was driving home from work.

Right now I'm paying about 15% of my salary into retirement savings ($7,800 pre-tax toward a 401(k) equivalent and $5,500 toward my Roth each year), but if I put NO more money toward retirement, and don't touch my accounts, I will (conservatively, 7% ROI), have $2.2M when I retire, plus the pension, plus I'll own my home.  So would I be justified in saving 600 less per month (essentially dropping the pre-tax 401(k) donations)?

"This morning I woke up with a bank notification on my phone about a $500 charge. I immediately opened my mobile banking app and the charge has the following description: ""POS AUTH (card's last 4 digits and today's date) CHASE ACCOUNT OPENING OHU S877-682-4273‬""

My debit card is from a different bank, I don't have any accounts with chase. Apparently, that Chase phone number is legitimate. However, they tell me they don't charge 500 dollars for any of the accounts they offer and apparently I'm not the only one that has called to ask. What is strange to me is that the charge appears as a POS charge, so my theory is that this is a scam and the people responsible just used that description to mislead the victims and give Chase a hard time. I already cancelled my debit card and my bank is issuing a new one. The charge is still pending, so I have to wait 2 or 3 days until it posts, and then I can file a claim for the unauthorized transaction.

Currently owe 109,900 at a 4.6% interest rate/30 year fixed conv. Loan, we have PMI that’s roughly $78 of our mortgage payment.

"Hi all, just looking for some new advice. Due to a period of issues that had major impact on my finances, I'm trying to recover from some hard hits to my credit.

I do not have any bankruptcies. I do not have a car loan or mortgage anywhere in my credit history. Unfortunately, I do have a lot of late payments and am just around 90% in that area.

I also have a default on a student loan, which I have since paid off, but it only happened a year ago (both the default and the pay off). I'm frustrated by that default because I sent multiple rounds of paperwork and check stubs in an effort to get a deferment. I am probably in the wrong, technically, as I wrongly assumed each time I sent the documents they asked for, that the matter was cleared up; this had always been the case in previous deferments, so I was just operating on habit and history. But each time, they wanted more from me and never reached out to let me know that. I'd reach out every so often only to find that my deferment had not been approved and I'd send them what they would always say were the last documents they needed. Anyway, the result was this default, which happened at the same time that I got a large bonus check, so I paid the whole thing off right away. Can I dispute this though, and get the default removed?

For a while, I was using all of my credit cards each month, small purchases, just so I could pay them off each month and register on-time payments. I had high balances when I started working on this, but paid down thousands in about six months and got myself below 10% utilization. During this time, playing with the utilization, I opened another card strictly to use strategically just to improve the overall situation. It did help.

I feel like I don't know where else to go from here, but I would like to improve further. I have three medical collections, each under $500 (no other collections). I intend to do pay for delete on those, if I can get the companies to agree. I stupidly paid off 3 other collections by making deals, not realizing they wouldn't be deleted or that pay-for-delete was a thing.

Is there anything else I can do here? I'm in the low 600s. The good news about that is that i started in the 460s and made mt way to 600 in a very short time. My main problems now are that student loan default and late payments. It seems like correcting the late payment situation is just a thing that takes time to correct with on-time payments. Meanwhile, what else can I do? I'm in a much better spot financially. I'm making good decisions. I'm doing everything I know how to do. Are there any obscure tricks out there? Anything besides the basic advice that every article gives on credit repair? What's the fastest way to improve that I'm not already doing?

Editing to add that I'm in good standing on my remaining student loans. Is it wise to consolidate them??

"Hello all,

&#x200B;

I won't deny it. I have lived above my means for about a year now which has landed me in about 12K of debt. I have 11 months to spend down as much of it as I can before I head off to law school.

&#x200B;

I have $2800 on one card (maxed) 0 APR for 15 months (Chase)

I have $1400 on one card 24.99 APR. (Chase)

I have $8339 on another. 0% APR (Discover)

I make $1166 a month through my stipend.

I have about $2000 in savings.

The discover card is the easier to keep money off of. It's not through my bank so I don't spend any additional money on it.

&#x200B;

My bills are these:

$27 on phone bill

$240 student loans (cannot reduce)

$25, $28, $167 in minimum payments on the cards

I live with my parents and I do not pay rent.

I eat out for lunch and I try to keep it under $5, which is less than I used to do. I usually buy coffee in the morning which is $3.25. I go out some weekends and spend $100 a weekend at the bar/resurants. I order delivery on Sunday's.

Obviously, I am going to start bringing my lunch. I have mostly cut down my coffee expenses, by drinking the coffee at the office. I maybe treat myself to one iced coffee a week. I am going to cut out my delivery on Sundays and bar/restaurant expenses. However, sometimes I gotta go out or I'll just get stir crazy and bored.

My job that pays this small stipend is ending in November. I am looking to get a more lucrative job that pays more. I am also looking at getting a bar tending job two nights a week and doing odd jobs.

&#x200B;

What else would you all recommend I do? I know it's bad, but I am determined to discipline myself and beat this.

&#x200B;

Update: 

I will be getting a new job as of December first. Seeing as my stipend is less than minimum wage my income is bound to go up. 

&#x200B;

Also, based off of these suggestions I have taken steps to tackle this since I have posted. I have closed the card with $1400 on it using my savings. 

&#x200B;

I'm gonna dig myself out of this whole I got myself into.

"I took a new job last year at a relatively small company.  I was not eligible for their 401k plan until just recently.  What I've learned so far is that they do offer a 401k plan with an employer match (20% and a 6 year vesting schedule), however, there is no way for me to access the funds online or to choose how I want to invest the money.  At my previous employer, we had a Vangard account where I could log in and see my account summary as well as choose different stocks, bonds, or funds to distribute my contribution to, so it seems really odd to me to just hand over my contribution and not really see what's going on with it.  Now, granted, I have not yet signed up and have not asked very detailed questions about how all of this will work, so I'm going on somewhat limited information.  But I do know from talking to other employees that there is no way for us to personally manage the 401k funds.  Since I haven't signed up for the plan yet, I'm not even sure if there is any visibility to the account online or otherwise.

&#x200B;

So my question is - one, is this normal and legal?  And two, what kinds of questions or requests can I make of my employer within reason to give me a better idea of what happens with my money and/or will better prepare me to decide if I truly want to take advantage of their 401k plan (because to be honest, even with that match rate, I need to stay for 6 years for it to become mine and I'm wondering if I wouldn't be better off starting another account of my own that I have access to and can manage myself).

&#x200B;

"Is there any way that this article isn't as terrible as I think it is?  If it's as incorrect as I figure, it should almost be illegal to be so misleading about such an important subject.

[http://amp.kiplinger.com/article/real-estate/T025-C032-S014-making-extra-mortgage-payments-not-so-fast.html](http://amp.kiplinger.com/article/real-estate/T025-C032-S014-making-extra-mortgage-payments-not-so-fast.html)

&#x200B;

In his point #1, the author reinforces the classic misunderstanding that making an extra payment does absolutely nothing more than take one payment off the end.  Maybe someone with better knowledge can correct me if I'm wrong, but not having given an actual principal or interest rate, the best I can figure from his total payment and breakdown of principal and interest is that this hypothetical loan is somewhere in the neighborhood of $143,500@ 5.75%.  Even then, his hypothetical final payment is not what he says, but it's the only combination I could find that worked out to his initial breakdown.  His extreme example only goes to completely destroy his argument if you do actually do the math, since if you were to make extra $2000 payment in the first month of that loan, it would save you almost $9000 over the life of the loan - and that's still not bad for a return on investment.

&#x200B;

He then magically figures out mortgages in his point #2, and is correct that paying the extra every time would cut off almost two thirds of the loan (completely contradicting his first point), but then goes on to say that just saving your money at the very same interest rate (one that would be very difficult to find today) would actually work to your advantage.  He does so by assuming that after you pay off your mortgage 11 years in, your either give away or burn the $4000/month that you're no longer putting toward your mortgage.  If you saved whatever sum of money you weren't putting toward your mortgage for the full 30 years - at the same interest rate, you'd at least come out even, if not ahead simply due to fractional rounding working to your advantage instead of disadvantage in the mortgage.

&#x200B;

Point #3, I don't know enough about inflation to comment on - I'm guessing he's wrong and plainly leaving something out.  (my gut is that having money sitting around would also be hurt by inflation).

&#x200B;

Point #4, he completely ignores that the person who bought their house with a mortgage paid interest (though he doesn't give a rate) that entire first year (not to mention closing costs, loan fees, etc), so quite clearly, the person who paid cash would still have made more in that exact scenario.  I'm not sure why he even brings the seller into it, as the seller gets the same amount in either scenario (is he assuming that the seller only gets money as you make payments??)

&#x200B;

Now, I'm not trying to say that it's always better to pay down your mortgage than to do other things - the math of arbitrage is to put your money where the rate is best - pay down your highest rate first and, generally speaking, making money at a higher rate is better than losing it at a lower rate.  Obviously, plenty of exceptions (like wanting to have some cash for potential expenses, etc, etc) apply - but all of the actual reasoning and math in this article is still, as far as I can tell, completely wrong.  Am I missing something here, or is the article as bad as I think?  Especially considering comments on the article are disabled (and I'm guessing the author either knows he's wrong and doesn't care, or would assume he's right and not listen to anyone that would correct him, making contacting him likely pointless), how do the sane/moral people in the personal finance community fight back against supposedly professional advisers spreading fallacies like the ones in this article?

"I'm thinking of heavily investing in real estate over the next couple of years to build equity and semi-passive cash flow through rental properties. I'd like to buy a house a year for the next 3 years. I'm considering sacrificing my 401k contributions so I can build up my savings. I did some preliminary math (explained below) and I was hoping I could get comments about my idea. 

One of the largest reasons I'm thinking of not contributing is the past two jobs I've been at I've never hit the vesting schedule and its crushing watching 15k of ""my"" money disappear in the blink of an eye. There's a fairly good chance I'm not going to hit the 100% vesting schedule for this job either because I tend to move around, so I feel I can find a better use for this money then let it sit in a target date fund. 

&#x200B;

$98,966 *(base salary)* \- $6,000 *(6% 401k contributions)* = $93,024 *(gross taxable income)*

$93,024 - $91,901 *(low boundary of 33% tax bracket)*  = $1,123 \* .33 = $370.59 *(federal taxes paid @ 33%)*

$98,966 - $91,901 = $2,331 *(federal taxes paid without 401k deductions)*

\-------------------------

$2,331 - $370 = $1,961 *(tax savings (now) by contributing to 401k)*

$6,000 - $1,961 = $4,038 *(annual increase in cash flow w/o 401k contributions)*

&#x200B;

This extra cash flow will push me to roughly 45k in net cash flow after all other investments, taxes, living expenses, food/going out expenses. If I make \~400/month in cash flow from the first property (which I'm planning on purchasing soon), it will put me closeish to 60k/year which is enough for a 20% down payment on a 300k, multi-unit home.

 Is it possible to collect unemployment and decide to go back to college and subsequently apply for student loans? My situation is that my current contract is going to expire and I'll be out of a job, looking at whats available for what I want to do i'm lacking skills that seem to be common for them. My thought was to use that downtime to go back (i have a bachelors) to college for these skills.

"Recently I've come to a realization that I'm not managing my money well. I'm 4 years out of college and in a total debt of about $66k.  I didn't come from a family with a lot of money, and my parents really never taught me the importance of saving money and how to manage money. They have always been in debt, and I feel like I'm following their footsteps, which I don't want to do.

This is an overview of my current debts

* $30k in student loans with interest rates that vary from 3.86% - 6.8%. Minimum payments are $490, and i've basically just been making minimum payments.
* $8k loan for my motorcycle with a 5.9% APR, minimum payments of $190
* $9.5k for my car with a 3.5% interest rate, minimum payments of $225. Which I refinanced through the bank to get some money to pay for credit card debts. The car is probably worth 5k now. 
* $19k in credit card debts. I've been trying to move the cc debts around with 0% APR for 1 year with balance transfers that have a 3% fee. I have about 4 accounts with \~$4k balance on each. So each time I move my balance, I pay \~$140 fee. But that gives me about another year without getting hit with the \~20% APR interest. Each account have minimum payments of \~$100.

I live in a house with roommates and my minimum monthly expenses are $500 rent, $45 cable/internet, $\~70-90 utilities. 

I'm currently making $80k/year, and maxing out my 401k. After taxes, med insurance, and 401k contribution, I'm getting about $4.4k/month.

1. Should I stop 401k contributions and focus on paying off debts? The contributions are taking \~$500/month pre-tax, but company will match $.50 to for every $1 up to 8% of my salary, so I'd be missing out on some free money. 
2. What's the best approach to get rid of my CC debts? Consolidation? Just keep doing the balance transfers?
3. There was a PLR for 401k matches based on student loan payments. When will that take into effect? 

And I know I have a spending problem, I should probably have lived at my parents house out of college to pay off my debts first. Asking for any advice that anyone may have.

"I bought a 2005 Expedition nearly 6mos ago from a reputable, family-owned dealership chain, for 7k. Less than 100k mi. Just put brand new tires on it and put a new stereo in. On the way back from a camping tri the vehicle started running extremely sluggish and eventually died on the side of the hwy. No CEL. No warning. As I recently just purchased a new home and my wife is expecting we decided to try and troubleshoot it ourselves. Towed it home. Ran diagnostics. Put in new plugs. O2 sensors. Mass air filter. Fuel pump. Still running weird. So after over 1k in parts and many hours we had it towed to a local Ford facility. They said the timing chain jumped time and it would cost $2500. After they get into the engine they find out that the cams have been replaced, along with a number of components, with 3rd party parts. Basically the engine was rebuilt with cheap parts. The dealership nearly doubles the cost of the repair. 

None of this info was given to me from the initial dealership. The car fax did not show any work at all. 
We were given the option to buy a warranty on the unit at point if sale, but the cost, at 3k (half of purchase price), was too much to justify.

"My father passed away back in March, and my brothers and I received the payout from his life insurance policy. We split it evenly, with each of us receiving $25,000. I dont want to touch this money unless I absolutely have to. I just want to allow it accrue interest while I add to it over time.

"Hello! I have been considering doing a PTA program at my community college, and have been working towards it, but I feel like I’m going at a snails pace. I work full time in order to live with my boyfriend in our apartment, but I only make $10 an hour at a job which won’t look great on a resume (it has no skills and a monkey could do it). It’s literally just the best paying job I could find as quickly as I could. I’m casually looking for another job that pays better.

I was trying to think of a way I could go back to school full time when my boyfriends mom recommended student loans. I told her I already had all the money to pay for school, but she says I could use it for my bills. This is something I didn’t even realize I could do. Now I’m trying to figure out if it’s worth it.

-I only need two years worth of bills at roughly ~12,000 a year. When my boyfriend gets his promotion in a year or so, I was going to quit my job and go to school full time anyway, so it might only be a year of student loans. He would be making enough to support us. 

-I could stop wasting time at my $10 an hour job, and bang out my college much quicker, and start making good money. Working full time it could take ~5 years, instead I could finish in ~2 years.

-I was considering colleges with faster PTA programs, but I could stay at my current college which is really good (harder and longer), and would guarantee me a job when I graduate pretty much. 

-I could get my scholarship back by going full time again.

-I would be getting $25-$35 an hour when I graduated.

-BF and I would both be making ~$40,000 a year in about three years and we could save like crazy for a house and everything. Rather than me only making $15,000 for the next 5-6 years it would take to finish my degree taking only 2 classes at a time. 

Are there any cons I should consider? Being in debt is of course one of them..would there be consequences for not working for a year or two? I would probably pick up a part time job. Mostly for spending, odds and ends, and saving.

"Hello, PF'ers. It's me, ya gurl.

Or, rather, your resident bundle of frayed nerves. It's been a while! Earlier this year, this subreddit helped get me on-track during a really frightening time and gave me a kick-in-the-butt regarding changing up both my budget and living arrangements to better address my health issues. Since then, things have been going incredibly well and I'm just two weeks away from moving abroad to a warmer climate that'll benefit me medically. And I'll actually have a partner to help me out; so I won't be going-it-alone for once. All-in-all, things are looking the best they have in years.

Which has made the last few days some of the most anxious of my life. I thought I had everything nailed down with my budget; but I really underestimated the costs of prepping for a move. On top of that, I've lost a ton of freelance writing work over the best few weeks due to a mold growth in my apartment that my new landlord (my property management changed suddenly a month ago) is dragging their feet on fixing -- like the last one. I've had three infections in the last month, so that's really compromised my already-stunted earning power.

The good news is that the trip and costs related to the move are already pre-paid and covered. The last major expenditure I have is affording the medicine I need to buy in bulk and bring with me, since it'll be prohibitively expensive abroad. So, I know this isn't as dire as it feels; but whooooooo. This stress is eating me alive, guys. This is my first major move and my first time going abroad, so this is huge for me.

What would be your advice for any ways to earn money quickly over the next two weeks for someone with a disability? (A tall order, I know.) I need to get up about $300 to pay for my meds; and then I think I can manage the rest. And is there anything I should know about traveling abroad when it comes to finances or spending? Like I said, this is my first time out of the States, so I'm flying blind here.

"Quick back story: My wife and I bought a home last April when we relocated for my job. Since the home purchase, she has doubled her income and mine has gone up over 300%. As a result, we are now in a position to buy a slightly nicer house and keep our current one as an investment if it makes sense.

Some of the numbers:

Purchase - $232,500
Still owe   - $204,000
Payment  - $1,563 (mortgage, taxes, insurance)

At the time, we only made about $90,000 combined, but we now make about $260,000. We are looking at purchasing a new home in the neighborhood of $320-350,000 and keeping our house as a rental. It’s not a NECESSITY to have a newer home, we realize, but it would be nice to be in an area closer to our offices to cut down on daily commutes, with a little more space for a family, at a relatively small portion of our new income. We live in a hot renter market where home values are going up 10-15% per year, and rents are rising rapidly despite the market being flooded with new rentals and home inventory being low. Right now, though, we are looking at getting about $1,500/month for the rent on the house, so we would be out of pocket $60 or so per month plus repairs and vacancy, what ever those end up being. 

I have no doubt that we could easily cover both mortgages for a while if for some reason we ended up with a vacancy, and cover any repairs that are needed on the house as a result of renting. Within 2-3 years I’d expect the house to cash flow positively with no updates, or we could probably get it to cash flow positively now with a little work, but we aren’t looking to have that work done if it’s not a necessity. It was actually flipped two years ago, so it’s fairly up-to-date. 

My question is simply: is it generally a good to rent a home where you’re getting negative cash flow when other benefits can bring the investment to a positive net return? We are still earning on price appreciation over time (most likely) and the mortgage paydown is like $300/month so if I’m thinking of this properly, we will be coming out ahead now and will have a great cash flow within a few years when rents are up. We are 24 years old and don’t plan to move any time soon so we think it’s an excellent idea but maybe I’m missing something? Thoughts?

"Hey guys, I'm getting married in November, and I'm more the numbers-minded person in the relationship, so it's fallen on me to work out our budgeting and stuff. I'm wondering what kind of advice you can give on pros/cons of different ways to split up income, accounts, bills, etc. 

My vision as of right now is for us to have a joint account for shared expenses and savings, and then each of us have a separate account for personal saving.  Right now, our income is a bit unequal, with me making about 60-65% of our household income, and my fiance making about 35-40%. We're currently splitting bills out of our own separate accounts along that 60/40 line, but if each of us were to contribute, say 50% of our check to the joint account and 50% to individual, the joint account would have that 60/40 split built right in by virtue of larger contributions from me.

I think its important that each of us have an account for our own discretionary spending and saving, but I also believe a marriage works on the ""hers is mine, mine is hers"" principle, thus the shared account. I also think paying along our percentages is the fairest way to contribute, but I'm open to having my mind changed on any of the above points.

"Ok wonderful people in this sub, thanks for taking time to read this and I apologize in advance for formatting, I’m on mobile. Also I apologize for grammar mistakes. 


Ok so to start out I am a sales rep for an auto parts company. My current average take home is about 1750 a month after taxes. Sometime a bit more, rarely much less. 

My current monthly bills are as follows:

Rent & Utilities - $653 (my half, $1306 w/roomate)

Car payment - $210

Phone bill - $150 (in a contract I can’t change for a while)

Furniture payment - $296 (this will only last 1 or 2 more months as I will have it paid off and is $148 per paycheck)

Fuel - $60

Now this wouldn’t appear so bad since it leaves me with an average of $381 a month extra but now we get to my credit card debt. 


USAA card - $3000/$3000(this one has interest on it but they have yet to charge me and I’m unsure why)

Chase platinum card - $500/$500(no interest till next may)

Best Buy card - $950/$1000(no interest till next April)

Chase sapphire - $0/$1000(this one is coming as I thought I had a plan to crawl back from this but I’d rather get advice from people smarter than me)


Now while the reasoning behind my debt isn’t your problem but I’d like to give a short reason behind it, feel free to skip this paragraph if you don’t care. The usaa card I got for moving expenses and eventually just kept using it with no remorse. The chase platinum I used for every day things or when I used all my cash before payday. The Best Buy card I used to buy my brother a new phone when I was in a much better financial situation and just haven’t paid it off. 


So now if you have made it this far I wanna thank you again for taking to time to read this. I know all of this was due to my poor planning and financial management. I’m just looking for any advice you can offer. Also one side note, I’ve looked into my phone bill and it is locked up tight, nothing I can do on it for at least 6 months. I just need help.

"Hello! I was looking some advice on where to park my retirement funds. I'm 33, and have been reading /r/personalfinance over the years learning how best to invest and save for retirement. So far I've been keeping it simple, and picking Target Date Retirement funds. I have an old TSP, a current TransAmerica 401k, and a Vanguard Roth IRA, all in the respective Target Date Retirement 2050 funds. By and large for retirement I'm a set-it-and-forget-it as far as however the market's doing, so whether everything's up or everything's down I don't make a lot of changes since I'm not expecting to need these finds for \~35 years. As such I typically would accept higher risk since I wised up about retirement planning late and wasted a lot of early years only getting the company match and leaving it in bonds.

I was looking at my allotments for the year for the TA 401k, when I noticed that my ""personalized rate of return"" was only  \~3%, which I thought was odd since I would assume at this point the holding were mostly stocks. I looked at the performance of all the funds available to me [https://www.ta-retirement.com/Funds/FundPerformancePF.aspx?cat=0&ci=970985&si=000&fi=0&mdp=0](https://www.ta-retirement.com/Funds/FundPerformancePF.aspx?cat=0&ci=970985&si=000&fi=0&mdp=0) and saw that all the TA Blackrock Lifepath target date funds had YTD returns of \~4%, lagging behind the YTD performance of various stocks options sometimes by double digits. I checked my vanguard Target Retirement 2050 fund in the Roth IRA and saw that it too is only showing a YTD performance of 4.25%.

&#x200B;

I understand that stock performance can swing wildly from great returns to huge losses, but I thought the Target Date funds would track closer to current stock performances. Even the TA BlackRock Lifepath Index 2060 fund only has \~3.48% for the year. Why do the Target Date funds appear to lag behind, and for the TA 401k specifically would it make more sense to move out of the TA Blackrock Lifepath Index 2050 fund into a blend of Stock funds?

"Hello,

So I'm pretty new to credit cards since I'm 18 but I got accepted for my very first credit card with BMO a few days ago and for some reason I have a $2,000 cap with 4% cashback.

"Hello,

I'm in the process of trying to buy a property in San Francisco. It's a process that is quite stressing, because in doing it I'm tying a lot of my financial resources (and debt) into this property and I want to be sure to do the right thing.

&#x200B;

I'm working with an agent (as customary) that I got through an agency referral

  
I have to say that he has been pretty active. Following an initial inactive period, after I showed actual interest in buying a property (saving properties on their MLS platform, asking him questions ... etc) he started being very responsive, he sends me regularly properties to look at and replies to questions at anytime of the day/week (mainly requests for getting building disclosures). This during weekends and late at night as well.

  
What I'm more concerned about is the quality of the answers to my questions ...

Overall he doesn't seem to know much about building quality in general. He has never been able to give me a satisfactory advice on the structural quality of a building and San Francisco being an old (most building are built in the early 1900s) and earthquake prone city I find this probably the most desirable quality of a realtor.

 I asked him multiple times questions about the foundations or seismic upgrades and it seemed clear from the answers that he has no clue about advantages and disadvantages of the various types of foundations or seismic retrofit work.

He also didn't seem to get what a land liquefaction risk area is and what kind of risks having a house built on such a land with very high liquefaction risk entails.

In general I got generic answers like ""the foundations have been recently upgraded the listing agent says"". Of a property that was clearly on a liquefaction zone he told me very convinced that instead was located on top of bedrock (I had to point it out to him clearly the map that showed that it wasn't the case).

After a while I think I started losing confidence in the advices about structural soundness and started relying on him only as house hunter and viewing scheduler (he does a pretty good job at that) and started studying myself those things to try to understand the disclosures in the best way possible.

&#x200B;

"Hi PFers, 

I'm a 53M who has been through a divorce, the financial crisis and some other financial issues over the last few years and heard that there's some sound advice to be given out here. I have $100k in cash from very aggressive saving and working side jobs over the last 1.5 years, but other than that I have no retirement savings, I rent an apartment on a nicer side of town and want to try to position myself for as good a financial future as possible. I know that I am far behind where I should be for someone my age, but ideally I would like to be able to buy a home in a nice or up and coming neighborhood for myself and my children (I have 3, who are now starting college, but I'd like for them to have a nice home to come back to) and work toward some sort of savings goal for a sustainable retirement plan. 

&#x200B;

All of the advice I have seen online so far is for people in their 40s, but I am 53 and anticipate working for at least the next 10 years if my health permits in that time. 

&#x200B;

I don't have a great credit score, I own one small quadruplex in a pretty sketch but part of South LA valued at about $600k (that's its value at the moment, but I am not sure how much the value of the property will fluctuate as the housing crisis here works itself out; I bought it for about $300k a few years ago but still have about 15 years of mortgage payments to make.) 

&#x200B;

I work as a consultant and make at least $102k per year (gross) and receive about $5250 in rents. My major monthly expenses are my car ($220/month for note and insurance, payments will be over in 34 months), rent ($1500), mortgage for the income property ($1800), food ($200), and some other random expenses and obligations.  So after paying what I need to, I am left with at least $4280 per month to put away or use how I want. 

&#x200B;

The problem is that at my age, I know that it is possible that I could have to stop working at anytime due to unforeseen health issues, etc. I wasn't really financially able to save or think about these things before now because I was repaying debt and paying child support.

&#x200B;

I am wondering whether anyone has advice as to what the best money move would be to ensure that I have enough to live on.  I am open to selling the income property, but it would likely require some major exterior maintenance to increase curb appeal.  If anyone has been in a similar situation or can give advice about investing, selling property, etc. for someone who has historically not made great financial decisions, I would be open to all of it.

"Its a pretty confusing story but i'll try to write it as concisely as possible. I hope this is the right subreddit.

I am a person over the age of 18, under the age of 22 living in Australia. I currently attend uni and have a part-time job where I work 2-3 days a week. 

I used to live at home with my mum. My mum gets government help to partially pay for the house that we use to live in (I now live in it by myself). 

The issue began when my mum moved four hours away with her boyfriend, into a house that her boyfriend rents. She left me here to live in the house that the government helps pay for. She is pretending that she still lives in this house, and still pays the partial rent, but lives four hours away with her bf. 

Basically it is a very uncomfortable situation for me... and it currently got worse, as my mum and her bf broke up. Instead of coming back to this house, she wants to remain in the suburb that she is in now. She rang me and told me that in order for her to stay there, she needs to inform the government that she wants housing in the new suburb. Which means that I would need to leave the house that I am in now. 

The issue is that I dont think that I am in a financially sound situation. I make around 200 aus dollars a week at work, and receive 300 a fortnight through the government. The average rent prices for a single bedroom is 350 a week. 

I could go to the government agency and claim as an independent (as my mum basically ditched me and moved 4 hours away) which provides me with rent money, but that would lead to them finding out that my mother is commiting fraud by living 4 hours away while pretending she lives in her previous home. The big issue with this is that I have a younger sibling, who is with my mum, and I dont know how that would affect her. My mum is also technically helping me right now, by paying for the partial rent for the place im staying in now.

I think that I may be able to just survive if I had to rent a place, but I feel like I need a little advice. Idk, I just feel really uneasy about the situation im in now and not sure what to do.

"Im a personal finance newbie that’s trying to navigate down the road of financial freedom (i.e. my knowledge is lacking but I’m eager to learn!!!) 


Earlier, I had this thought, but since I don’t quite consider myself financially literate, I’m not sure if this is a smart thing to do or not... please feel free to correct me as needed... constructive criticism welcome as well. And if you feel you need more details, please ask. So, here’s what I thought:

I have about ~$8,900 left on my car loan. I plan on keeping this car until I physically can no longer drive it (ie no plans whatsoever of purchasing another/new car in the near future). 

My current car payment is $228/month, and I believe the interest rate is at ~4.5%. 

According to my calculations, if I pay $495 a month, I can pay my entire car loan off in 18 months. The downside to this would be that I have less money to put in my savings. The upside would be that 1) I no longer have a car payment and 2) I could put that $228/month in my savings (would eventually like to invest), which means I would then be able to put ~$700/month in savings/investments (I currently put ~$500/month in savings + the $228 from my car payment). 

Some (maybe useful) details: 

Aside from my car loan, the only other debt I have is ~$18k in student loans. I’m currently still in school so no required payments yet. 

I have 2 credit cards. 1 is an $800 limit and currently $0 balance, the other is an $850 limit with a $300 balance that I plan to pay by the end of this week. 

As I mentioned, I currently put roughly $500/month in savings, so, essentially I would just be putting this toward the car loan (and maybe budget to still put ~$100/month in savings while paying off car loan so I’m not completely lacking in savings). 

The parts that scare me a little are 1) I wouldn’t have much money to put into my savings during this time and 2) it would take a little more effort and discipline in regards to budgeting to make sure I can pay $500/month on my car loan. 


Is this a smart thing to do? Are my calculations accurate? Should I try to pay off my car in 18 months? Is doing so worth it? 

Constructive criticism and advice welcome!!!

"Hi,

I'm new to Personal Finance so sorry if I'm formatting this poorly or if i'm leaving out information just let me know!

Lately I've been feeling like my mental state has been terrible after realizing how much debt I am in. All in all, I wish I made some different decisions on where I went to college but regardless I am about 39,000 in debt (32,000 of unsubsidized + subsidized and 7,000 in a private student loan from Discover) and just started my 5th year. I'm majoring in Business Management of Information Systems so hopefully I can find a job to pay it off smoothly. Anyways, this year I took out a private loan of 7,000 since my cap has been met on federal loans. I ended up taking out too much, and left myself with 3,200 additional dollars after everything (paying for dorms and tuition). It's been sitting in my account for now, but I really feel like I need to quit my part time job to ensure that I survive my last year of upper division courses which have been getting tough and time consuming. While I've been doing really well in school maintaining a 3.5 GPA the last 2 years, I have this constant fear that failure of even one class will cause my debt to skyrocket even higher. I am no longer scared of how long school will take me to finish but rather how much money I am going to owe at the end of it. I've been advised by a friend that if I quit I should try and budget very hard to use as little of my loan money as possible to survive the semester which ends December 23rd. In total, my balance including my own money and the leftover loan money is about 4,500 dollars.

My expenses really are only my iPhone payment ($41.66 per month) and my food expense which I'm unsure what I'd look to aim for. I'm guessing between 200-300 dollars per month?

Is it a dumb idea to quit my job for my mental sanity and focus on school by using some of my loan money to survive until December 23rd?

Hey there, I just recently turned 19 and I’m going into my third year of college (skipped a grade) in California as a mechanical engineer.

I have around $27,000 saved up from jobs (also already have a car) in the past but I’m currently unemployed so I can focus on the tough school year ahead, as well as other engineering projects I’m involved in. I have no debt and will be using about $17,000 of the 27k to pay for housing for the next 2 years of college, as my tuition is paid for by scholarship.

I don’t like the idea of my money just sitting in a savings account for the next few years and would like to get into investing or some other way of making a return. I don’t think I can start a Roth IRA yet since I am unemployed (same with a 401k). I know I have it pretty great financially right now so I do not wish to take any major risks.

I’m looking for recommendations of how to utilize my savings to increase what I have because I’m sure many on this subreddit could do a lot with close to 30k.

I'm studying Electrical/Computer engineering and she's studying Nursing, so assuming all goes well, we can both expect decent incomes upon graduation; but until then our money is limited. We both have part time jobs bringing in about $1100 a month, which covers rent. My parents pay for my college and housing, so I only pay groceries.

"I have been living with my husband in the same duplex for four years. It is pretty nice, a little small, but a good price for the area. We have been wanting to purchase a home in the same area. I made my landlord aware that we are thinking of buying a home in the future but not really that it may be before our lease is up. She really likes us, and has said before that she hopes we won't leave anytime soon. We have a pre approval for a loan already and a decent chunk to put money down.

Where we live, buying a home is expensive. A good friend is our real estate agent and let us know about a house that just went on the market that is VERY well priced, and seems about the perfect size for us. We are seeing it on Tuesday but if it goes well and we really like it, I feel like it might be good for us. She also told us that buying any month before March is good because after that the market is super competative. A house in this price range that is newly updated is super rare.

Our lease has nothing in it saying some sort of positive alternative to breaking a lease. I'm sure she would let us sublet but would probably still make us pay some sort of something. So I guess that's the issue... has anyone else dealt with this and was it worth it, and how did it go?

Alternative is to stop looking for houses and stay in our place until June or closer to June and hope to find a home around the time the lease would end.

"I am 30, single, no debt, work in government as a policy analyst. I make a respectable salary ~$81,000. This allows me to max my 401k and IRA, and I have an emergency fund, but do not have the ability to save much more for the short term for something like a house.

Normally I work 40 hours/week, but recently circumstances have required me to work double that (with overtime). This is only temporary but has made me realize that ordinarily, I could be putting some of my free time to good use and saving more money. 

I’ve enjoyed this stint, working hard and being productive feels good, though ultimately I know it would not be sustainable to work 84 hours/week without stopping. Still, I want to supplement my income and I could certainly go beyond the 40 I normally do, by adding an additional gig on the weekend. 

I’m looking for inspiration for possible ideas though. I practiced law for a short bit, got burnt out, and switched to where I am now. Ultimately, the prospect of re-entering as an attorney is somewhat appealing considering I went to school for it, perhaps even eventually getting a job as an attorney with the government where it would be less stressful. 

However, I left the profession without adequate real world training, making it somewhat difficult to just walk back in. One possible idea is finding a part time gig doing legal research and the like to slowly build my skills until I can one day pivot back full time. However, seeing as how I would be giving up my weekends for this endeavor, it would be great if this second gig was also fun (aka not endlessly shepardizing caselaw or responding to discovery requests). On the other hand, the advantage is I don’t really need this job to get by, which makes the prospect less stressful and leaves the ability to walk away if I so choose. Also, there is a part of me that genuinely misses law even though a lot of it is boring as all hell. 

Still I’m hoping y’all might be able to inspire me with some supplementary gig ideas. Passive income is certainly an idea, but I know nothing about owning/managing property and it seems too daunting to dive into that just yet. Plus I think I’d like to do some more traditional “work” at least for now.

Hi everyone! Hoping some people who are alot more intelligent than I can help me figure some stuff out. 

I am 25, going back to school for IT which I love so far...but my life is kind of a mess financially for me. A year ago I had a bankruptcy due to alot of debt but in retrospect I regret doing. I have a bachelors in marketing but after 2 years working I left to go back to school. 

Financial Aid will cover afew months of rent, I work at a bar to help pay other bills currently. My financial aid will help until beginning of December. My current job will pay my other expenses with very little to save outside of that. 

Rent $847 a month, other bills $700 a month and then with gas and food about $900 Edit: As in all my bills combined is $900 about. Food is $100 a momth gas $100 a month. I work part time at a bar right now. Donating plasma I can make $280 a month and bar money if I average $200 tips a weekend and than monthly hourly earnings $300 or so, I should have $1380 a month net income. 

My goal is to save money for rent on the months my financial aid wont cover, (December, January, May, June, July, half of August) 
If I take out $900 in bills a month from the $1380 I can save $480 a month and thats me not going ou, not buying games, not doing anything else with it at all. 

I am ineligble for other loans and cards etc. I know of and my family cant cosign as my family is small and also bad credit (hope someday I could change the trend). 

Is there any kind of savings, bank, credit union, account etc. I can do or anything else to eventually get in a good place or just save as much as I can and be as frugal as possible? Like my life is ok, single, live alone (because mid bankruptcy I stayed on my lease as I knew I couldnt get another place post bankruptcy so on my 3rd year of my lease) but I sometimes get very depressed due to financial life. Only reason I am making this post is due to this intense feeling of hopelessness it feels like and hope maybe someone can help me gameplan. I want so bad to get out of this rut and make a brighter future for myself. I dont date, or even go out due to my life either and as an extroverted individual it definitly sucks.

"I have been knocking my head on the wall for a few weeks debating the best decision for the family. I have a wife, a 1 year old, and another on the way.

Currently in a house where I am paying 50% of take home pay towards my mortgage(N. Va). This is after putting into 401k, insurance, and taxes. I am early into my career, and I make around $76k/year with a 12% bonus every March, so about $85k a year total. I owe about $8500 on my car, about $3500 in misc debt, and have $37k in student loans. I have less liquid money than I would like, with possibly two months of emergency funds. At this point, I am breaking even each month and barely denting my student loans.

So the dilemma is whether to sell the house, and move further away from work, or to stay put and tough it out a few years until my career and pay advances. Housing gets much cheaper about an hour from work which is double what I am driving now, so 1 hour a day to 2 hours a day. The drive is highway and back road driving, so no bumper to bumper. Doing the math for transportation costs, it is about $1250/yr more expensive by getting into a cheaper used car that gets 40mpg and I do the maintenance myself. The greatest benefit is that I could save about $700-$1000 a month on mortgage depending on the cost of the house I buy, and by selling my current home I will have about $45,000 in the bank account to either pay off debt, invest, or just have as a safety net. A new house would allow me to pay off my student debt in about 3 years.

**The cons:** driving costs, longer commutes for other activities and shopping etc, less quality schools, housing appreciation won't be as high, and risks driving longer amounts of time.

**The pros:** cheaper prop. taxes, cheaper mortgage, $45k in the bank, better yard/neighborhood, better house.

I would really appreciate others opinions in this matter in what they feel is the best decision. I wonder if the peace of mind being financially savvy living in the sticks with a longer commute is worth it compared to that of great location.

Thanks.

"First a little background:
I was homeless 2 years ago and have since gotten a room to rent and been continuously promoted at my job. Right now I pay $600 a month for rent, have a cell phone bill of about $120, and my only other expenses are transportation and weekly spending money on groceries. I work really hard and have a strict budget. I just got a recent promotion that has me making about $31,000 a year after taxes. I live in Southern California so I’m pretty lucky that at the moment my monthly cost is pretty low. 

I had a family member pass away a few months ago and just received a check in the mail for $12,500. I was already planning on leasing a car and found a lease that will get me a decent car for around $220 a month with $2,200 due at signing and am probably going to move forward with that in the next couple weeks. 

Here is where my question really lies- I am 30 years old and have basically been living check to check my whole life. I know to some people $12.5k might not be life changing money but it certainly is for me.

How much should I invest and what kind of account or accounts should I open to best serve the money I now have?

However, Fidelity offers a range of mutual funds, including total stock market, total international stock market, and total bond market index funds through Vanguard, with their much lower expense ratios (.035%, .11%, .05%).

I was thinking of changing my contributions to just buy the appropriate proportion of these three funds, with a plan to rebalance annually and change the stock/bond ratio appropriately as the years go on.  I would effectively mimic a Vanguard/Fidelity target retirement fund.

So, quick background... I have recently had a significant life event in which I can no longer afford the mortgage on my home. At the same time, I need some money from the sale of the home to pay some rather large bills. My home is for sale at 215k, and I owe around 168k. It has been on the market for approximately 5-6 weeks without selling, although I did have one offer that ended up not going through for a few reasons. 

For the past one year my parents have considered moving across the state to the city in which I live. They currently own a home valued at roughly the same as mine(214k). In the last couple of days we started to talk about the option of them selling their current home and buying my home from me and I could live with them for a short time, meaning I wouldn't need to move immediately and they could get a new house in their desired City. Of note, they own a second home out of state and are currently retired.

My question is: if they were to sell their home, would it be better to sell them my home at the same price as their current home (both listed about the same), or just give them the home and they could pay me the net value I would get from a sale using the money they get from their sale? Would I save realtor fees? Would they qualify for a loan to buy my home if they are retired? and lastly do we need to be concerned about gift taxes? Also, are there other options?

Early 30's couple, 2 kids - 5 years and 3 months

Me, f/t - 80k

Wife, p/t - 35k

65k retirement assets

140k home equity

12k cash assets

2k college savings

11k student loan debt

&#x200B;

We are selling our old house, currently under contract for 335k, Bought new house for 415k. Currently refinancing (family bridge loan to new house). We are very fortunate to have 140k in equity from the previous house (net after commissions, concessions, closing costs) to apply to the new house. Wife wants to stay at home with our infant which puts me on edge but is the right decision for the family. Under this situation we will likely cash flow neutral while she is out of work but there is risk for slight cash flow negative over this time.

I am and have not been happy with our cash/emergency fund situation (we got a late start to our careers and had kids before building a nest egg). For emergency fund and peace of my mind, I want to put away 25k out of the 140k from the sale of the old house (note we will immediately spend 5k of this on new house repairs plus a few furnishings), putting our emergency fund/rainy day at about 30k which is 3-6 months expenses plus money for home/car repair.

My wife, who is not financially savvy but is technically correct, does not like the idea of borrowing the additional 25k over 30 years. She is right that we will pay more interest over the 30 but with that logic why not throw every penny we have in checking at the mortgage? My thought is that the sale proceeds give us a one time ability to fix our cash position, which is deficient. Plus we are going to need some for insurance while she is out of work. When she goes back to work in the future, we can pay down the mortgage.

FYI The monthly mortgage payment goes up about 100-125 bucks due to cashing out the 25k. I alone will bring home $4600/mo and i anticipate we will spend about $4500/mo with the new mortgage, bills, etc.

So I have many thousand shares of stock in a corporation that has had an amazing run especially over the last decade or so and I am wanting to diversify my holdings, as about 65% of my net worth is tied up in this stock.

The basis in the stock is around a $1 a share for most shares, with some even less, as they were purchased near inception of the company.

"Hi all.

This is my first time getting a collections letter. It is for a valid debt, I moved out of my apartment and owed around $150 for some moveout fees that my security deposit didn't cover. I was in the process of moving, and so the original letter they sent the month I moved out didn't end up reaching me.

I've now received a collections letter from National Credit Systems, it appears to be legit since it matches the debt I have from the late letter's I received. Since it's now in collections I have a few questions:

- Do I now pay the apartment directly still/have the option to, or do I have to pay the agency?
- Will this affect my credit score? I have a very good credit score at the moment, and this is the first thing that could be a potential negative hit I've had in a while.

But what do I ask for?  Some important details - I currently live in Southern California, and the position entails oversight of five stores in the San Francisco Bay Area.

My best estimate is that $80k would be a healthy number, leaving room for savings and a decent standard of living, but that seems high to me (perhaps just because I come from a lower income area?).

"Background info:

 I have an episodic disorder, that I tried to get diagnosed when I was 14. They (multiple specialists) said that it was some form of autoimmune disorder but couldn't figure out which one. Doctors over the years, tended to just shrug their shoulders, or worse, told me it was solely BC of my weight.

It came and went over the years, getting worse each time. Generally comes every 2-3 years.

unrelated, I got ptsd, which meant as a teen, I was unable to work. I finally fixed my head, and part of that was moving away from my home city. I can not move back home, for my mental health.

Before I moved.away I wasn't able to work mentally, so I had very little money, so no savings. I was overdue an episode.

I got a job... And an episode came. I have never had one this badly. I got so tired I couldn't eat after work. (Even with my partner cooking dinner) I would be crying in pain. I had recently lost about 30 kilos,  which meant my cardio had been improving.. for the first time ever I enjoyed running... And overnight I struggled to just walk to the bus stop 300m away, when previously I had been walking 1.5 km and feeling good.

I sucked it up, and started to see a new gp, and I have some referrals to specialists.

At the moment, I can hardly see out of my left eye. I'm laying in bed typing this because I'm so worn out, and in so much pain.  


**The issue:**
I live in Australia.

Disability here requires  you be 'diagnosed, fully treated and stabilized'.  So if I am unable to get a proper diagnosis, I can't get it. If I can't afford treatment, I can't get it. If the outlook isn't stabilized, I can't get it. If I don't meet the requirements for the table, I can't get it.

If I can't get it, it means I will have to live on unemployment, which is 490 dollars a fortnight.

Rent is 240 a fortnight, and there is no where cheaper, except share houses, but with my disability, that's not really an option. (I am unable to keep on top of chores, for one.)

Internet is 30 a week, phone is 7.50, I put 40 dollars on my transport card,

I don't see how I can sustain this. ",11,1537174754.0,personalfinance,9gfvq8,0,"Im disabled, unable to work, but i cant get disability.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9gfvq8/im_disabled_unable_to_work_but_i_cant_get/
"Hi /r/personalfinance,

Throwaway/new account just... because lol.

I feel a little silly about this because I never really liked the idea of taking loans I don't strictly speaking NEED-need, but as I look for my first car, I'm wondering whether or not it's safer to just finance a pretty low-cost car.

We can buy a 5k car outright, but we live in a pretty high COL area. Bf and I are 25M/24F and have credit scores of ~800/760 (respectively). I have a steady job, bf is a student and sub teaches (so less stable). We're looking at 2nd gen Priuses (so something like 4-7k in our area) and are restricting ourselves pretty hardcore to 4-5k, which is the most we'd ideally pay outright.  Were we to finance, we could expand a little and would treat the money we otherwise would've payed outright as though we didn't have it at all.

Admittedly, I'm generally terrified of spending money. The thought of something suddenly happening is horrifying and so, aside from being able to up our budget a pretty small amount, the attractiveness of a financed car is having some leeway if something happens one month (the idea would be to pay it off extremely aggressively - something like being able to do 1k a month instead of 6k right at the moment). At the same time, not having more debt (~10k of subsidized student loan payments that is comfortably under control) sounds nice and I'm sort of ironically put off by getting advice to finance (by people I know are financially irresponsible - e.g., my mother suggesting we finance a 12k car to build my credit when the main thing affecting my credit is the average account age being too low - range of maybe 4-7 years? - and the overall debt amount - from student loans, no credit card debt - being too high).

I just want to figure out something in the next few months - it isn't exactly urgent, but it is very nice to have for convenience and we also semi-frequently visit home ~500 miles away. Taking a Prius with at least 2 people and a dog is certainly cheaper than 2 people and a dog flying (particularly around holidays) or 2 people flying and boarding a dog, and it would add up FAST (like...$60 round trip vs $600 just for the two flying in non-peak season). As for the monthly fees (e.g., insurance and parking), a single monthly bus pass that does NOT cover the entire area is just over $80 and doesn't include our subway system which does not have any kind of unlimited pass.

Any advice would be awesome.

Thanks!

"My situation:

Wife and I are paying off our mortgage next month. Huge financial burden off our shoulders. We paid it off in 11 years instead of 30 due to….well, lean living. :)

 I’m 40 and wife is 38. We have no debt. No credit card debt. No student loan debt. No mortgage(next month, I mean). Zippo.

Our goals: Invest wisely enough in retirement, but also invest wisely enough in Michigan Education Savings Plan(MESP) to put our two children through college. Yes, we might not be able to pay it all off, but we want to do some to help out.

As a teacher, I currently contribute $200 per check to a 403b and have done so for over a decade. It is building up nicely and I am now going to double my contribution to $400 per check. I should have enough at retirement to….well, not make up all my salary at retirement, but I should have a reasonable pay-cut that won’t sink us. I won’t go into details here….but I should be roughly OK at retirement. I will get my teacher retirement pension + my investment and be more or less OK. Wish it was more….but yeah, we’ll be fine.

1. How much do we need to contribute to a MESP per check? My daughter is 10 and my son is 8. What would $250 per check(500 a month) look like in 8 years, interest included? Is that helpful much?

2. My wife has a 401k at work she has not been contributing to. Her salary is not that high, but her company does a very small match once per year. Depending on profits, they do 50 cents on the dollar match once per year, maxing out at $1000.  Should she invest in that or should I just increase my 403b contribution? Is the price match better than the interest I’d get on my 403b? 

a. Simplified question - Is it better for her to throw $100 per check into her 401k(2400 per year) knowing that the company would add $1000 to it annually OR should I add $100 per check to my 403b, making my total contribution $500 per check?

I hope I made my concerns/inquiries clear.

I wonder everyday how it's still running so well. I dont really care to fix it or keep it into the winter because we have deep snow and the truck cant handle it, and is not safe in the snow. 

I am living with my parents and hate it. I feel so childish but at the same time it's a great way for me to save up as well as be repaid for how I grew up (we got evicted a lot and my dad started taking my money for bills instead of spending his vodka funds on them. I saved us from countless evictions and helped multiple times to feed the family with no thanks. Part of me, honestly, wants to live here for free as long as possible because of that.) I am, hopefully, starting work at home soon so I wont have to commute as much, but I would still like to get out of here.

"Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that it is never a good idea to cash out a 401k early, despite my current question.  I would never think about doing it, but I have had some unplanned circumstances occur in life .  I graduated with a doctorate last year, and have been working in a new position where I earn roughly $82,000 per year (4200 per month after taxes, 401k, insurance, etc).  My wife was recently laid off from her job.  Total monthly expenses are 3200, so we won't have issues paying bills or continuing to save money.  Monthly expenses could also be cut a few hundred depending on us dropping streaming services, shopping at cheaper grocery stores, etc, which we are planning on doing.  Approximately 6k in savings, but we have been working on that.  We recently found out that she was pregnant, despite our best efforts.  While we weren't expecting it, it was something we planned on for the future.

Our plan was always for her to be a stay at home mom, because daycare costs would take about 3/4 of what she would normally earn in her profession.  Daycare ranges around 900-1200 per month, she would make approximately 20k before taxes.   We were also working hard to pay down as much debt as we could prior to starting a family.  Currently there's 21k in student debt, 10k on financed car, around 80k on the mortgage, and 50k on a loan from my credit union that I used to pay off a bulk of my student loans to get a better interest rate.  We have no credit card debt.  I have a 401k from my previous family that has 33k.  I understand the taxes and fees that come into cashing out early, but I was wondering if taking that 19k and using it to pay off the car and a chunk of the student loans in order to free up 450 dollars a month or so would make sense.  Again, I know the general advice is to never cash out early, but I'm concerned that that \~1000 extra dollars a month won't go far with a new baby in the family.

"Hello everyone, 

I have been reading a bunch of guides on how to build good credit, but I feel like I need more organized help to build my credit score.

I recently graduated in April and got a full-time job in June with a 40k salary. My co-workers (who are in their late 20s and early 30s) were talking about credit cards and such, which got me interested in making one since I never really bothered to. 

While surfing the internet, I decided to apply for a chase credit card without knowing my credit score because someone told me that Chase would give me one even if I had such a low score. (which was wrong, obviously). I got rejected right away and I was worried that this was going to affect my credit score. Luckily, I only had one hard inquiry which did not affect my credit score greatly. 

The current credit score I have is 638. The only account I have is the student loan, which is at 21k and three years old. I am still in the grace period, but I paid twice so far to lower the interest. My car payment is paid by my dad (lucky me) and I live with my parents since the job was close to home. I don't have any bills to pay other than my loan. I was thinking of visiting my branch bank to get some help, but I feel like I need to have some knowledge before walking in. 

What can I do to improve my credit score? I thought about asking my dad to add me to his credit card as an authorized user, but he claims that I would not receive any benefit from doing so. (But Google says the authorized user should receive the benefit). I have $6k saved up in my bank account if this information is needed.

I took this to heart and spent the last year pouring myself into work. I found myself in one situation after another that gave me opportunities to perform and show my worth. In January I got put on a huge project that gave me responsibilities way above my pay grade. 

I've been constantly the youngest and least experienced person in the room for meetings on this project. With this advice rattling in my head, I leaned on my peers and used the opportunity to grow and learn as a scientist - both personally and for my company.

"Hello friends. I am a 24 y/o living in the DC metro area (Arlington, VA) with a buddy from college. Both he and I have stable jobs with similar salaries (75-80k) and a year lease coming to a close in the middle of November. We have been searching for new, cheaper alternatives to our current apartment complex as it feels like robbery. Around $1600/person for rent and associated fees. He and I, along with my old college roommate who is living in DC, are entertaining the idea of buying rather than renting for the obvious benefits. The college roommate has a similar salary as well. Homes supporting our work locations start at 550 and tend toward 700-800. I really do not want a condo, nor does my dog. I have not spoken with a mortgage agent yet as we are very early in this process.  Our intention is to remain living in the home for the next 5+ years and when we move elsewhere, form an LLC, and hold onto the property and rent it out. Plus it seems as though DC property consistently appreciates. Major concern is due to our short tenures in the professional world, we do not have the funds to support a substantial down payment. This may make the option infeasible but I’m not sure. Please share your thoughts. I also have ~600 in monthly fees for phone payment, student loans, car payments, etc. What are your thoughts?

Hi all,

I'm starting to invest in 401(k) with Fidelity and wanted some input on allocation choices. I'm 23 and my annual salary is $125k. I plan on maxing out the 401(k) in addition to a Roth IRA. Of the available funds in the link above, my proposed allocation is:

* 10% Bond - FID US BOND IDX PR (FSITX): 0.025% ER
* 63% US Stocks - FID 500 INDEX PR (FUSVX): 0.015% ER
* 27% International Stocks - FID INTL INDEX PR (FSIVX): 0.045% ER

I chose the ones with the lowest ER for each category following the 401k funds guide. I originally wanted to invest in a target fund but the ERs seem much higher, especially for JAKYX which is at 3.06%. How does this allocation look? Any category I should invest less of in the 401(k) and more of in the IRA instead?

"Hello personal finance! I am in search of advice related to an entry-level offer. I interned for a company that I enjoyed (for the most part) this summer. This is a well-known, large logistics third-party company located in the Chicago area. They recently offered me $23.08 an hour ($48,000 a year before overtime pay) along with a decent benefit package and 15 days vacation. 

While I'm excited to have an offer with a company I enjoyed, I can't help but feel that $48,000 in the heart of an expensive city is a low offer. The prospect of overtime pay is nice, but it is under my major's average at my school (that average is $52,000). Beyond being below average, I have strong experience and already performed well over the summer for this company. 

My question is: Am I in a position to ask for more compensation? I know they offered other interns the same pay, so I'm concerned the salary may be set in stone. I'm nervous to consider walking away, but I also have reason to believe I could eventually land better pay elsewhere. I would love to work for them for just a slight bump in pay!

[What If? Scenario Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DA0_W-xyeB-OwxlsHv2c-zs7xUVlGpSKlX1_y_SJ7C8/edit?usp=sharing)
-

Above is a link to a What If? tool I made the other day. I often am wanting to test out different payment combinations and amounts towards my various debts, so I made this tool and my buddy suggested I share.

A quick rundown on how it all works.

First you'll follow the link, then copy the sheet into your own drive so that you can take real control.

Fill in most of Column B; there are cells for **income** (B5 - I recommend take home, not pretax), **cash** such as checking or savings accounts (B7-9), **credit cards** (B11-16), **loans** (B18-21), **investments** (B23-25), and what I call **CHEF** (Car, Home, Entertainment, Food; B27-28). The CHEF section is more for expenses, which are itemized further down in rows 35-46.

Column D is a sort of estimated payment calculator. In this column you'll put what you expect/can/hope to be paying. Most of these numbers are positive, though I use the Car Value under Investments to track devaluation (ballpark). In the Cash section, the estimated payment to Checking (D7) will calculate as Remaining = Income - Payments + CHEF. **In this case payments includes any payment to a credit card, loan, or additions to savings and stocks; I didn't deduct 401k because I'm using my take home as the income amount.* The items that go into payments and CHEF have a blue background.


The years essentially apply the payment you set in Column D, to the base amount you set in Column B. It applies the payment on a monthly basis, and I should note that I didn't really make anything to account for paying off debt. It just takes that amount and pretends you were still making the payment. Once I see a credit card line is positive, I pretend that I would still be making that payment, only I would send it to a different account.

Again I made this to test out different scenarios (Eg: Can I increase my payment on this card? What if I owed more/less on this account?). It's not terribly sophisticated, and is more to have some ballpark figures to work with. Please, play around with it, critique me, change the whole darn thing and send it back. I appreciate any and all input/feedback, and would love to make some changes to improve it. Thanks for reading PF!

Oh, and on the second sheet there is a Credit Age calculator. I use that to see what kind of impact closing/opening a new card would have on my average credit age.",4,1537163815.0,personalfinance,9gekp2,7,I use this to help me calculate some of those What If? scenarios when it comes to finances.

"It is for sale at $125,000. A 20% down payment would make the mortgage payment about $500/mo. I make about $3500 a month. Single. I have a small business selling stuff on ebay. I am pre approved for $135,000. I would plan to rent out at least 1 room of this house on Airbnb to offset some of the cost. I am very frugal and have no debt or car payment. Only cell phone and car insurance.  
  
My original plan was buy a duplex and long term rent one side. Nothing on the market though in the last few months. (USA: Indianapolis).  
  
I thought about just buying this nice single family house, which is 3 bed 2 bath partially finished basement and then waiting for this market to cool off to buy a duplex in order to bring in some cash flow. My debt to income ratio would suffer though after buying my first house, unless I really did a lot of revenue on Airbnb, and only after 2 years would that count toward DTI. Then again, I think that if you get tenant contracts prior to an investment home purchase it will count in favor of your DTI.
  
I believe this SFH, when I move out, would break even in terms of cash flow. Meaning it would rent for about $1000 and my mortgage is $500, 50% rule means it would be a 0 net. Is this a bad investment?  
  
I look at it as an investment but also I need housing. And in my market, buying is cheaper than renting. Especially considering I would have the freedom to rent out a room on Airbnb to offset the cost.

I am a pretty frugal person, I don't eat out at all, we cook everything.  for the last 6 months I have only purchased important stuff and have avoided things like video games. 

Is this a solid list?

"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I saw a thread or two about this, but I wanted to get some clarification. I'm moving my checking account from BoA to Chase (already have my Chase account set up). I have most of my funds in the BoA account still, with a transfer processing and the $50 deposit to open my Chase account. Even after that transfer goes through (expected to transfer on Tuesday), I will still have most of my checking account funds in the BoA account.

&#x200B;

I'm wondering how to go about making sure I avoid any fees while closing my BoA account? I read that I should go to a BoA branch and ask them to close my account and receive a check with my remaining account balance, but I also read that BoA will sometimes screw people over my leaving just a little money in the account, thus causing the account hold to accrue fees and such. I'm particularly worried because my parents have helped me build up a great credit score, and I'd hate to ruin that by making the wrong move.

&#x200B;

Once the transfer goes through on Tuesday, I will be changing all my auto-pay accounts to pull money from Chase (i.e., Spotify, Netflix, etc.). I will also be changing my debit card info on websites like Amazon, eBay, etc. so that any future purchases come from the Chase account.

&#x200B;

After that, what should I do? Is going to a BoA branch to close my account and get a check my safest bet?

  
Sorry, I'm probably overthinking what should be a simple process, but any advice/tips would be greatly appreciated (especially from folks who have closed BoA checking accounts in the past)!

"Hey reddit! I'm looking for some good advice here!

I recently moved from DC to California.  I own a condo in DC and decided to rent it out instead of selling it.  It's not certain how long I'll be in CA or where I'll wind up in the long run.  Also investing in property in DC seemed like one of the best ways to invest my money, security and return on investment.  The rent I am currently getting for the condo is about double what my mortgage / HOA / property management fees are, so I am winding up with a decent amount of extra income coming in.  I know I should find an accountant to at least get me set up for this first years taxes.  But I also wanted to get reddit's opinion on what the best way to invest and get the most out of this extra income I will be getting.

"Hey r/personalfinance ,

I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask this, but I'm in a crazy amount of debt and finally realizing it would be best to sell many of the things that got me into this situation, most notably for this post, my video game collection.

I posted on Craigslist and listed each game individually, mostly gathering what each one was worth from GameStop/Amazon. In total, about $1550 is what I priced everything at (a fraction of what I paid, but that's the industry). Someone just texted me essentially asking if I'd cut them a deal if they bought every single game.

What's the standard for a situation like this? Should I stick to my guns and just give him the above price? Is 10% off reasonable or too much? I want to be debt free and get the most out of this, but I also don't want to lose a potential buyer. Assuming it's a legit buyer in the first place.

"So I work in non-profit healthcare and I get that there isn't a lot of money to go around.  First year I got a 3.25%, second year 3%, third year 2%, and this year 2%.  

The last few years the healthcare sector went through a lot of financial difficulties.  Last year was especially tough for my organization.  Concurrently, we merged and they laid off the ""redundant"" people , mainly administrative, management, finance, etc.  and they started a new policy that we would not get bonuses to our retirement plans if the organization was not profitable for the year.  As a result, I didn't say anything when I got a 2% raise last year.  

So, this year we are doing a lot better, made money, and so we did get the retirement bonus.  Our performance review is rated 1-5.  Everyone knows me as a very good employee.  People rave about me, but I'm overqualified so it's not a difficult job for me.  I think I get paid well for the amount of work I'm expected to do.  My manager wrote nothing but good things.  However she has never given me a 5 for an overall rating, yet does not give me any constructive criticism.  

I was shocked at the 2% raise.  I thought since we were doing better, I'd get more.  I think a 3% is fair, but at this point is it worth bringing this up for $460?  What do I say?  I am also looking for another job anyways, but my career is something I've have been least proactive about...

"At the engagement party of a longtime friend, her parents told me out of the blue they would like me to have their spare, unused, old beater car for free. 

In a way, this could be a windfall of sorts. But I'm torn on whether to accept. Here's why: 

-I live in an urban center and have been surviving perfectly fine without a car. It would we be a wonderful convenience to have, but it's not a necessity by any means. 

-Though the car was offered for free, I wouldn't feel right accepting it without giving them at least a few hundred dollars. Then, there is the cost to own and maintain the car, which is money I could save, put toward my student loans, or do anything else with. 

However, there is potential that it actually makes financial sense to take on the car. I currently travel home (350 miles) every couple of months. Having my own car would add a huge degree of flexibility (time cost) over taking the bus or borrowing a friend's, and would be cheaper than the train, a rental, or flying.

Plus, the car is not worthless. If I buy it for $500, spend $1.5k to own it for a year, then sell it for $3-4k I'd end up in the black. 

Finally, on a less logical note, I've always been a car lover and a fan of this brand. I would get a lot of joy from owning and driving it. 

So, TL;DR: I don't need it and it's an expense I could avoid. But it's a convenience and pleasure, with potential financial benefits.

"Home purchase advice?

Howdy Folks,

[Using a throwaway account for hopefully obvious reasons.]

My spouse and I have only recently become serious about purchasing our first home within the next couple of years. Earlier this year, we got a pre-approved for $250,000 from a local credit union, but we didn’t really know what we were doing, and experienced what seems like a very hot market (Knoxville, TN). Houses have been selling incredibly fast for the ones we seem interested in. We let the pre-approval expire, and have since been trying to educate ourselves more, talk about what we really want/need, and SAVE SOME MORE CASH.

My Situation:

Age: Early 30s
Family: Married, with one child(<2). Hope to adopt in the future. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Cash/Checking/Savings: ~$90,000
Investments/401k/HSA: ~70,000
Pre-tax annual income: $89,000
Debt: Just a couple of credit cards that we don’t carry balances on. Ever.
Rent: $500/mo

Zillow Market Overview: https://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public/realestate/ZHVI.Knoxville.394753.pdf

When purchasing a home, the plan would be to split most (75-80k) of our savings between a down payment, and ~6ish months of expenses (dependent on mortgage payment). We do not hate our current renting situation, we just realize it’s not our long-term plan.

Question:
Is it time to buy a house? Is it stupid/dangerous not to go ahead and buy? (assume we know we want to be in the area for at least 5 years, and we find a house we like) – The market seems hot, and I know it’s ill-advised to try and time it. But the indecision and analysis paralysis is strong with this one. Thoughts, advice are warmly welcomed.

Bonus Question: Given the situation we're in, what's the maximum price of a home you would buy? As someone who wants to minimize debt, I lean towards keeping things cheep. Curious as to your thoughts.

Enough of the background though, onto the problem. I currently DON'T have $700 to spend on a new phone. I don't NEED a new phone, but my 6 overheats a lot and is really slow. I want to get a higher end phone so I don't have to upgrade for a few more years.

I have two scenarios here:

1. Save past my birthday and wait a while to get a used phone off of eBay, then sell my current phone.
2. Sell my current phone (goes for about $150) and put that towards the monthly payments, which will be about $34/month.

I am personally leaning to the 2nd option, for a few reasons. First being that when I turn 16, I will be working a lot more since state laws loosen up a bit, and that I will be getting promoted to a cashier. The $150 can go to covering the monthly costs before I turn 16, and then I can actually work enough to earn $35/month to cover it.

On top of that, after I begin working more, I want to pay the phone off a lot quicker than 30 months. If I don't miss two payments, I can put more on my monthly payment to get it paid off quicker.

Is this the right way to go? My mom actually gave me the idea by saying she might be able to help (since it would technically be a birthday gift), but I'm not sure if my Dad will like it.

"Here's the situation. I just refinanced my last $39,500 worth of student loans with my bank at a 3.55% interest rate for a 10 year term. The monthly payments are $391ish and is locked in at that payment.

I have about $35,000 in my bank account. I live at home with no rent and no expenses, I just paid off my car. And I make $5,000 a month as a 1099 employee.

If I pay my loan off before 4 years I get 2% of interest back.

Snapshot:

* Age: 23
* New student loan refi: $39,500 @ 3.55% 10 year. $391 monthly
* In the bank: $35,000
* Monthly income: $5,000
* No rent (will live at home for basically the next year)
* No monthly expenses (besides food and entertainment)
* No retirement or investments... yet

"I graduated in May 2018, 24 years old, and am now employed full time by the company I have worked for for approximately 5 years. There are a few things I would like to get sorted out now that I have a salary, and employee benefits, mainly my 401k.

Simply put, I graduated with about 146k in student loan debt, which I have been paying in small amounts since graduation while studying for licensure exams. At this time it is a smidge under 142k. All the loans are from WellsFargo

* Loan 1 - 5.25%
* Loan 2 - 4.99%
* Loan 3 - 5.24%
* Loan 4 - 5.00%

I am currently using unbury.us, and the avalanche method, to pay off my loans. My base salary is 120k, but by picking up extra shifts I can definitely earn more than that per year. I live with my family, so my only expenses are my credit card which typically stays under $500/month, and my leased car which is $199/month. My current plan is to put $2-2500/paycheck, or $4-5000/month towards student loans, and save the remainder. Based on the website, I should have them all paid off in the mid-end of 2021.

My employer has an employee stock purchase program which I am enrolled in and put forth 15%/paycheck. They match 100% of the first 5%, but I am VERY lost on [which funds to choose.](https://imgur.com/a/A1Gdyib)

I tried reading the wiki on here and made some simple selections of

* Socially Responsible Fund (NRSRX) (85.4% US stock/12.5% non-US stock)(Total operating expense (TOO) 0.66%)
* Aggressive Lifestyle Fund (34.2 US/37.3 non-US/26.3 Bonds/-6.3 cash/8.5 other) (TOO: 0.38)
* Global Equity Fund (RNPGX) (51.1 US/42.9 non-US) (TOO 0.51)
* Diversified Bond Fund (92.7 bonds) (TOO 0.43)
* Core Equity Fund (99.3 US/0.4 non-US) (TOO 0.08)

Was an idiot and went to a private university and even with a 25% academic scholarship still borrowed $150k. Have whittled that down to $57k as I write this(only debt I have). Want to be debt free as soon as possible. I work in the media/entertainment industry and have 3 job offers.

#The Mountain West Job

* $75,000 annual salary, $55,750 net annual($4,645 monthly). $1,500 relocation assistance via expensing. Median 1BR apartment rent of the area is $900.

* Job is located in a city west of the rockies with a relatively low cost of living. Of the 3 cities I have offers for I know I would be happiest here. Moving here would be low stress and easy. 

* The job itself is the least prestigious of the 3, its with a smaller company, and I feel would open the least doors down the line

* The job itself would be new territory for me, so there is no guarantee I will be successful. It's a change and I won't be able to apply the forward equity I have had with my past jobs with it to claim ""X number of years of experience"" doing it. On the flipside, it diversifies my job experience portfolio.

* I would have 2 direct reports under me so it would give me more management experience for the resume

* I'd be able to make the most progress on my debt here.

#The Eastern Seaboard Job

* $86,000 annual salary, $62,725 net annual($5,225 monthly). Median 1BR apartment rent of the area is $1500. $3k pre-tax relocation assistance.

* The job is located in a Northeast City with relatively high cost of living but nothing like New York City. However the cost of living is closer to NYC than the Mountain West job.

* Of the 3 cities I have offers for, its the least appealing place to live for me. Just screams ""boring"".

* The job is the same exact job I had previously, only in a larger market, so I know I would be successful at it. I can apply my forward equity in my past jobs with this position to gain even more experience at it. 

* I would have no direct reports so I would not be able to add management experience to the resume

* I'd make about the same progress on my debt, perhaps slightly less, than the Mountain West position

#The New York City Job

* $90,000 annual salary, $61,075 net annual($5,100 monthly). $5k pre-tax relocation assistance. Median apartment rent of the area.... lol. 

* New York City terrifies me. The cost of living is ridiculous, I'll be taxed out the ass, and the fact I am not a city person at all. I've lived in a city before, downtown, and hated it. Relocating sounds like a stressful nightmare, especially finding a place to live.

* It would be difficult to make a lot of progress, if any, on my debt.

* I would have to sell my car which is not appealing to me. To me having a car means freedom, I hate the concept of relying on public transit even if it does really work as well as people say

* The job, however. It's by far the most appealing of the 3. You've all heard of the company I would work for. This job would open the most doors and be an amazing additon to my resume. Plenty of room for growth and advancement.

* The job itself is very similar to what I have done in the past with a few changes, so I know I would succeed and can apply my forward equity to it.

* I would have 2 direct reports under me so it would give me more management experience for the resume.

#Basically here is how I size up the situation right now:

* The Mountain West job is the best short term decision. Lowest cost of living, a place I know I would enjoy living that appeals to me and excites me. Unlike the other 2 cities, I wouldn't be sitting there counting down days on the calendar until I have worked there long enough to where I feel like I could start looking around to move again without feeling guilty about it. I could easily see myself planting my roots there. However, the job itself is a change and the least appealing/prestigious and there's no guarantee I will be successful, and while it would be a nice resume addition from a diversification/management experience standpoint, I don't see it opening as many doors, but you never know.

* The Eastern Seaboard job is the safe but boring pick. The net income is highest, but the cost of living/rent prices probably makes the Mountain West job the one where I would have the most money leftover to pay down debt and such due to lower cost of living. I have 5 years of solid experience doing the job, I know I would be a rock star at it. The location, while a metro area, is a lot more open and not a sprawling metropolis like NYC is, so I would be more comfortable. However it has far less upside than NYC but without as much of the downside. Again, the safe but boring pick. I'd be able to add onto the years of experience I already have doing this job and with that experience hopefully be able to jump to a market more appealing to me doing the same job or better making more money in a couple of years. 

* The New York City job is the high risk, high reward pick. NYC has a lot of downside for me personally, but the opportunity presents a lot of upside. I'd probably have to make a lot of sacrifices and drastically lower my standard of living to what I am accustomed to, and my progress on my debt/financial future would come to a grinding halt, but the job itself is awesome and exciting. The company is highly respected and would be great for the resume. I could see it opening so many doors down the road. This job sounds like one where I'd have to sacrifice a couple of years of my life and live out of my comfort zone and hope that it ends up paying dividends down the line. At 30 years old, still single with nothing tying me down, its probably now or never to do something like this. However I don't know if the pay is enough to make all the stress and sacrifice worth it, especially as a 30 year old still trying to pay off debt and get ahead financially. At the same time, there's no guarantee this job will do anything for me in the future as well. I assume it would be a great resume addition, but you never know.

"Background - I'm a 3rd Year Accountant, I live in NJ and work in NJ. 

I was just offered an opp to move onto a larger firm.

I was passed over this year for a senior promotion (due to dip in performance from family issues and being moved into a new section) however- with make due - I still earned a 6% raise and they were happy I was coming around. If I got senior I'd be making close to what the new place is offering. I still went around and shopped a bit just to see what I was worth.  

My job currently pays me 63,500; the new location is offering to pay 70,500 with a 1500 sign on (if I leave within a year I have to pay it back.) I will owe my current employer $1550 (after tax) for a CPA package they purchased for me if I leave before January 1st. (yay 2 parts passed taking another part in 3 weeks :)).) I have been with my current group for 4 years, 1 as an intern then we merged into a larger firm.  Multiple people have been quitting left and right at my firm. We have 500+ and our office alone, 12 staff/senior have quit; Everyone thinks this is due to salaries not going up fast enough. 

two points:

\- I currently live with my GF and we alternate dropping my dog off everyday to my parents house. If I took the new job, my 1 hour drop off + commute would become a 2 hour drop off + commute. On the day she is not around (as a research scientist she travels 25% of the year) I would be picking up and dropping off my dog twice, being a 4hr commute instead of 2hr commute. It's literally the equation of More Money but more travel; or less money, less travel. OR we could pay a dog sitter to come and dog sit 3 days a week (GF works from home 2 days a week.) 20-30$ a pop (lets say 70$ a week.) I've tracked some traffic the past two weeks and the 1 hour commute I thought I had was really a 1hr20m commute with traffic. 

\- Next year we may make a move west for her to get a better job in her field. This would be between May and Aug. New company does not have any offices in this location; I'd have to pay back this sign on bonus of 800$ now vs. 1500$ later. 

&#x200B;

So my question? Do I take this Job? OR do I gamble, take it, ask my job currently for more money and then tell new company no (I dont care if I ever get a chance to not work for this company.) OR just decline this offer and go off into the sunset and see what happens in a year.

Benefits are similar.

"I've had my current credit card for about 2 years, and I've used it a lot to pay off immediately and build up credit. Except I didn't realize that while the card has my name on it, the account is in my mother's name, she just shredded her card. I guess it was just to keep an eye on my spending and to make sure I had a high enough limit to put some university bills on it. It just really sucks that it took me nearly 2 years to realize all the credit I built up isn't actually mine.

I'm looking into moving out of the place I share with roommates into a place of my own sometime next summer or fall after I graduate. Hopefully, I'll be going to grad school. The place I'm living now has my lease co-signed by my parents because of the lack of credit thing. I really don't want my parents to co-sign a new lease and feel entitled to my space like they do now. But I can't get an apartment without having credit.

"Well, here it is - I need to lay this out and get some serious help.  I have just lost a relationship with an amazing person in large part due to me not having my shit together.  I have been seriously slacking in many aspects of life and have accumulated large debt while going through a bout of depression for a few years. I live in the Los Angeles area where we all know the cost of living is intense.  I went through a bout of depression over a 3-4 year span where I felt like I became not myself - and in that - I got pretty lazy with work, accumulated large credit card debt, and eventually feel like I threw my hands in the air and gave up in a lot of ways.  I had an amazing girl/relationship that just recently fell apart in large part because of my lack of drive and where I am in life at my age.  I work as a server at a decent restaurant.  Hourly, I do great as far as money goes but my total income is inconsistent and unreliable. Quality of life suffers. I also despise my job.

&#x200B;

I have a degree in Accounting from a good school.  I graduated during the main point of the recession, ended up getting into restaurants and retail due to not being able to find a job in my field directly out of school.  So since then, I have been stuck in either retail or restaurants - serving, managing, bartending, etc.  Currently I am just working as a server.  I feel trapped and so behind in life.  I desperately want to get out into the career world and carve a path for myself - I want out of this field entirely, as I feel it has sucked my soul away and made me into a bitter person.

&#x200B;

I need to knock out my credit card debt which totals just about $12,000 at this point.  I need to increase my income and make it more steady/reliable.  My other bills are also high, here is everything listed:

&#x200B;

Monthly Payments:

&#x200B;

Rent/Utilities - $950/mont

Car - $265

Car Ins - $125

Health Ins - $225

Gym - $65

Credit Cards - $500 min

Cell Phone - $100

School Loans - $275

Food - $400(?) - this is a guess - I'm a 200lbs guy who is getting back in the gym, so food adds up.

Misc - $200(?)

Storage Unit - $100

&#x200B;

This totals out to around $3300/month in overhead alone.  I don't make that much some months, and thus - credit card debt accrues and the hamster wheel spins.

&#x200B;

Credit Card breakdown:

CC#1 - $4150 @ 24.74%

CC#2 - $4475  @  15.99%

CC#3 - $875 @ 21.74%

CC#4 - $2345 @ 19.00%

TOTAL CC DEBT: $11,845

&#x200B;

INCOME:  My income is unreliable.  I want a career but need a second job immediately, I think.  Working in this industry depresses me further and I have a hard time working as much as I should - but it's what I know I can get jobs doing.

&#x200B;

If I work a lot, I probably max out making around $3500/month.  That's with a good month and working as much as possible.  Sometimes the schedule or shifts are out of my control and it could be considerably less.  I also have a whole massive load of shit in storage that I have been selling off.  I used to have a thrift store problem when I was depressed. I would buy things and just accumulate.  So now I have a storage unit full of mostly clothing that i have been trying to get rid of to help supplement income.  I wanted to use this stuff to strictly pay down credit cards, but it ends up just getting me by while still only making minimums on my credit cards.

&#x200B;

I'm at my wit's end here and just treading water or falling further behind.  I want to get a start on a career but a lot of entry level jobs that I may be able to get start at very low pay and I wouldn't be able to work that job + restaurant because of the hours overlap.  I would go back to school, but more debt is not my answer.  I'm lost in what direction to get started as I don't want to prolong the career move longer but at the same time - grinding out 2 soul sucking restaurant jobs might be the best way to pay my debt down.

&#x200B;

"I just found out that my dad is still opening bank accounts, taking out auto loans/leases, etc using my SSN. I say ""still"" because I actually found out that he was using my SSN for loans without my knowledge about a year ago after running a credit check, and I was really pissed at the time but I couldn't confront him because I'm still living under his roof, and I just assumed he would stop after that and pay it off eventually.

I'm moving out in 2 months and I basically just want to know what I can do to ensure this stops, and what I can do about the current loans and everything else he opened under my SSN? He's a really hard-headed person, and always thinks he's right so confronting him will most likely result in him going on about ""I did it for your benefit"" or something similar and it'll just be a waste of time.

"First off this is a throwaway so I can divulge as much financial information as possible.

I am a 23 year old single male who has graduated college in the past year and found a job very quickly making $17.25 an hour working 45 hour weeks with quarterly bonuses of about $450. This gives me a monthly income of **$2,720** after taxes and not counting my bonuses.

Doing the calculation of taking 30% of my gross monthly income ($3,277), I can afford a mortgage between **$983-$1,026** depending on if I want to count my quarterly bonuses or not. I've use 30% because that is the ""rule of thumb"" I've read around the internet.

My question is how much of my income as a single person with $14,000 saved up, no debt and no kids should go towards my expenses and give me the ability to live a comfortable financial life. I currently live with my parents rent free and my my monthly estimated expenses (when I do move out) are as followed.

_____
$32.09 | Gym (Not dropping this expense, I go 6 days a week, I get my money's worth)

$200 |  Car Insurance 

$300 | Groceries

$60 | Gas

$800 | Mortgage (estimated)

$100 | Phone Bill

$44 | Internet

$200 | Utilities (estimated)

$133 | Health Insurance (I live in the US, this is one of the cheaper options)

_____

These monthly expenses total out to **$1,969** and leave me with roughly **$751** a month left to put into savings, or my 401K when it kicks in, or a car note when my current one bites the dust.

My expenses seem lean already and I never go out to eat voluntarily. So why are my expenses estimated to take up close to **75%** of my income? Is this normal for financially stable people? Should I hold off on owning property? I would rather not rent because rent in my area is really high and I'd rather make an investment.

"Hi r/personalfinance


&nbsp;


Using a throwaway since there are people on here who know my situation who I don't need knowing my real account. 
I'm a 27 year old woman currently working in the auto industry (not selling cars). Sparing the details of how I got started here, I recently quit my job of 8.5 years after several pay structure changes and started a new job last week. I used to make around $78,000/ yr up until the past couple years where, due to those structure changes, it dropped to about $68,000/yr (before taxes). I've been at this new job for 1 week so far. During the interview my new boss showed me the pay structure / numbers and if accurate, I should be making ~ $82,000/yr before taxes ($4,000 / month base salary + 1.5% of total department gross profit bonus). Likely just under $60,000 / yr take home. 


&nbsp;



I was around 22 years old when I started making decent money after a couple promotions and made some stupid financial choices. I bought a brand new vehicle, helped a couple friends out, gave my dad a bunch of money for a business that ultimately failed, and racked up some credit card debt (10k at 19.75%). I went from having $12,000 in savings at 22, to being $22,000 in debt by 25. 


&nbsp;


At this point, my total current debt is $13,950 


&nbsp;


$2,900 is on a line of credit that's at about 10% interest rate now (used to be 7%, variable rate and Bank of Canada has raised it since I opened it) 


$11,050 left on a 5yr personal loan that I took out when I was 25 (3yrs left at current payments) and have been paying $358/month on since. Also variable rate, and is now at about 10% interest. 


No current savings. I did open a TFSA but I've been pouring all extra funds onto debt and none into savings. 


Visa balance is currently at 0. No credit card debt as of yesterday. 


&nbsp;


The total debt load when I opened the personal loan in 2015 was at $22,000. At that time the line of credit was empty, but I had to put $3000 back on it when I had to sell my vehicle (lost $1,000 in the sale, but meant no more car payments) and buy a new car (bought a $2,000 beater). So in 2 years I've paid down ~ $8,000, $2000 of that being paid just yesterday after getting my last paycheck from my old job + payment from new job.  


&nbsp;


Current Expenses: 


Rent - $900/month including heat/water/electricity (1 bedroom apartment, live alone) 


Phone bill - $140.00 / month 


Internet - $80.00/ month 


Car Insurance - $197.00 / month (I've shopped around extensively and this is the lowest I can get with 2 accidents on record) 


Renter's Insurance - $20.00 / month 


Gym Membership - $86.00 / month 


Gas - $215.00 / month 


Groceries - $450.00 / month 


Eating out / Entertainment - $350.00 / month 


Bank Fees - $29.00 / month 


Personal Loan Payment - $358.00 / month 


Pet Food / Supplies (cat) - $ 100 / month 


Netflix + Music Subscriptions - $20.00 / month 


This doesn't include unexpected expenses or shopping that isn't food related. 
I want to get the personal loan paid off ideally by the end of 2019 and not wait until I'm 30 to have that financial freedom. That would mean all extra money goes towards paying it off with nothing being put into savings. Is this a) possible and reasonably with my current expenses? and b) Wise? Or should I be making lower debt payments and putting some into savings. 


&nbsp;


Ultimately, I want to not be in debt anymore so I can go back to school and get out of the auto industry altogether. Right now the idea of going back to school and racking up more debt overwhelms me and I feel super trapped in my current career just to be able to afford living + paying it off.  Any advice would be much appreciated! 


&nbsp;


**TL;DR**
Started a new job and will be making around $82,000/ yr before taxes. Current monthly needs expenses around $2,970. Current debt $13,950 at 10% interest. Want to pay off by end of 2019. Is this realistic? Also, Help.

"Hi,

I have recently split up with my partner of 12 years, who has always managed all the finances.  It's been a very simplistic, pay bills, throw the rest in savings, type of scenario with no real budgeting.

   

&#x200B;

I am starting out fresh now, and need to go open new checking and savings accounts, start a budget, and figure out how to grow my savings.  I'd like to look into maybe beginner investing without getting over my head since I am still wrapping my head around developing a budget.  

  

&#x200B;

For now, I use Wells Fargo which is a shame because I have about 40k in savings and am earning basically no interest.  I want to start traveling more, so something with reduced / no foreign fees would be great.  After researching, I am leaning toward a Schwab's High Yield Investor Checking and Savings which might allow me to use it as a checking + savings which comes with a linked Brokerage and Trading Account that isnt required to use but as I get more comfortable with managing my finances and learning more about investing, I could potentially take advantage of that.

"Hey /r/personalfinance, I hope this is the right sub to post this sort of thing in. So here goes. 

I just moved into a new apartment in another state but have not completely moved out of the old apartment in the original state. The way the timing of the move worked out, I had to extend 'old' apartment's lease for 6 months, then move out a month before the end of the lease and move to 'new' apartment (due to when my SO's school semester started in the new state). So I would have to be paying for the month of October in 'old' apartment even though I'm completely moved out. But this I don't mind because they only offered 6 or 12 month leases so it's understandable that I should have to take the hit. 

&#x200B;

Here's where the trouble starts. My 6 month lease was drawn up and signed with landlord 'A'. I was explicitly clear that the reason I was doing a 6 month lease was because I would be moving out at the end of September and that I was ok with paying the extra month's rent. She didn't have a problem with this and I thought it would all be fine. Fast forward to about a month ago and we landlord 'A' is replaced with landlord 'B'. I spoke with 'B' about scheduling a move out inspection and she said we were supposed to have filled out a ""Notice to Vacate"" 60 days before the end of the lease. She is saying that **because we didn't file this,** **we must pay rent for the month of November**. (Because the 60 days will now start on 10/31, according to her). 

&#x200B;

Again, I made it abundantly clear to landlord 'A' that I was moving out and she never informed me of this mandatory 60 day notice. However, the biggest thing working against me in this situation is that, according to landlord 'B', **the 60 day notice is stated in the lease**. So, unfortunately for me, technically I signed a lease acknowledging the notice. BUT, I don't believe it's fair that I should be held to this rule because I feel I was misguided by landlord 'A'. 

&#x200B;

Extraneous spending like vacations or luxury items aside, how do people in similar situations handle living expenses, housing in particular?

"I'm constantly thinking about how should I go about buying my own home. So a bit about me I live in a poorer country in Europe, so prices are different from what you might expect so I'll try to give out as many numbers as I can.

So I just finished university and by chance I got a pretty good paying job (about 2000€/month net on average) and want to buy my own appartment, because it is cheaper than renting, even when taking a loan a monthly payment is less than what you pay your landlord.

The main thing I am thinking about is what kind of appartment to buy. I will most likely live my life alone, so I think saving towards a smaller appartment is smarter, but on the other hand the bigger appartments are easier to sell if need comes to be. What I consider a smaller appartment is a two room flat roughly 50m² in size that costs about 100 000€ in comparison to a bigger three room flat about 80m² in size that costs round 150 000€. The prices listed here are on a higher end of a spectrum, so if for example it is not smart for me to go this expensive I can go as low as 70 000€ / 110 000€ respectively.

The price of living here for a single person is about 200€/month in food (higher end) and about 150€ in taxes for the appartment upkeep (water, electricity, etc.).

So the question is how do I go about these things. Is it smarter for me to save up for a smaller apartment, or go for a bigger more expensive one for increased liquidity or other reasons I don't see?

Anyone know of ways to make good money at home or on the side? I've been considering dog boarding/sitting with Rover.com (my dog would probabably love that), selling pallet furniture on etsy (I have the tools and am pretty crafty) aaaaand that's about it.

"Hi All,

I have a credit card account and a personal loan account with this bank. The credit card has $0 balance and I have $8500 left on on the loan with a $360 monthly autopay. Recently the bank has sent to me a 15 month, 0% APR balance transfer offer letter and included convenience checks. According to the bank I cannot use checks directly to pay down my loan. But who’s stopping me from depositing into another bank’s checking account and paying from there?
At 3% transfer fee, I’m thinking borrowing $1500 to make sure I can pay it off within the 0% APR terms. It will be an additional payment of $100 per month to my loan, but it will bring down the principal. I just have to make sure the bank won’t slam me with cash advance APR if I deposit the checks. 
So, what do youse think? Good idea or not?",3,1537137327.0,personalfinance,9gazwx,1,Use convenience checks for personal loan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9gazwx/use_convenience_checks_for_personal_loan/
"First time poster!

Hey everyone! I'm currently with a local brick and mortar bank, and I'm considering going digital. I have narrowed down my options to Capital One 360 Checking and an Ally Savings account. The Capital One 360 Checking was an easy choice since both my credit cards are with them, and their app is awesome!

&#x200B;

However, I'm purely choosing to use Ally Savings because of their high yield. I won't be using the bank for any loans, but just to store away some cash for an emergency budget. For those of you who may use both, what are you experiences regarding transferring between banks? Are there any fees associated from going to Capital One 360 -> Ally Savings?

&#x200B;

I'm also considering just keeping everything to one app, and opening a 360 Savings account; however, I do not like their flat yield offerings of 1.00%. We may be talking pennies on the dollar here, but I believe 1.85% is definitely better over time for an emergency budget.

&#x200B;

**tldr**: Should I go with Ally Savings + Capital One 360 Checking, and, if so, are there any difficulties / fees I should be aware of? Optionally, should I just stay with one company, and open a Capital One 360 Savings (since I already have two credit cards opened with them)?",16,1537136970.0,personalfinance,9gayc4,1,Capital One 360 + Ally Savings,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9gayc4/capital_one_360_ally_savings/
"My parents are supporting me financially. I have an individual checkings account. My parents plan to send me money monthly to cover my costs of living.

It seems that there are ways for them to send me money directly, but that would be classified as gifts. After giving over ~$15k of gifts annually, they would have to report their gifts to me, which would be detracted from a lifetime gift exclusion amount before it started being taxed, so I would prefer not to do this.

I'm considering opening a joint checkings or savings account between my parents and I, so that they could easily transfer money to the joint account, and then I could easily transfer money from that account to my main account.

"Good morning, everyone. I’m needing some general advice for moving to a new city, potentially at the beginning of the year when tax returns come back. 

Currently, I live near knoxville, TN and I am looking to move to Nashville. It’s about a two and a half hour drive from where I live now, so the commute to move isn’t far. I am a single (technically) mom of two, one of which will be starting school next year, so I want to move before that happens (mostly because I want him attending a much better school system than the one were currently zoned for). I live at home with my parents for financial reasons currently, plus I am in college. I go to a community college currently but will also be transferring to MTSU, which is near Nashville, once I get done here. That is also a factor. My bills are taking up most of my paycheck currently, so it’s extremely hard to save. I don’t have much debt other than my car and $200 on a credit card, which I intend on paying off slowly because it’s all I can afford to do right now. My credit score is fair, it’s good enough to get an apartment, but not fantastic. I am working on it. I also plan on approaching my boyfriend to moving with me (this is why I said technically a single mom, he currently has no financial responsibility with my kids). 


As far as getting a job, I have family there that will probably let me use their address so I can eventually apply for jobs. But the problem will still be trying to manage my money and move while trying to get stable in a new job. I don’t think my family will have the capacity to let me and my kids stay with them until I get on my feet. I’d want to start looking for jobs probably before I decide to move, correct? But I also don’t know how long it’ll take me to get a job. I have tried to do research on average rent, but of course what is available now may not be come time to move. Plus I’d still have to find daycare, and most daycares have an obnoxiously long waiting list. So I guess I need advice on how to approach this from a financial situation. I know I’m trying to save as much as I can right now, but I currently don’t make much, and I don’t feel like I need to look for another job that I’ll only be at for a few months. 

My tax return is usually around $7K (the positive part of being a single mom). I plan on paying my $200 credit card off, but hopefully that balance will be much lower by the time January rolls around. How much of that (plus X amount saved) will help me get my feet in a new city? If my boyfriend agrees to come with me, he will probably continue waiting tables. My goal is to get a job at the airport as that is focused around my college major. Any advice is welcome. Please be kind.

*Salary 1*: $60k; 15k options

*Salary 2*: $72k; 5k options

**NOTE**: He said he thought offer was on the lower side, but said since it's an entry level system administration position, my lack of experience, they're kind of a ""start up"", I can work from home (could be argued in my favor), and unlimited vacation he thinks the offer is fair. They take care of my internet, phone bill, computer, office chair/desk, etc. too so that's value there.

I asked if it was negotiable, explained I thought it was more of a System Administrator II or higher position due to the tasks (*some projects listed below*) and I'll be the only person. **I asked for $90k** \- which is a comparable salary to someone in a System Administrator II position. I said I could show him research and data (any additional evidence someone wants to post I'm open to it). He said he thought $90k + 0 options might work, but due to the reasons on the ""**NOTE:**"" above, he wasn't sure. I said thank you and said I'll decide over the weekend.

We're reconvening on Monday. If I persist on $90k, he said he'll ask the CEO . I believe my point is within reason and I can achieve $90k. Don't want to let this go though. Do you all think I'm within reason and this constitutes $90k?

***TL;DR***: He offered $72k + 5k options, and said it was entry level system administration. I asked for $90k, and said it was more system administration II work (project list below). He said maybe possible, but due to lack of experience, work from home, and not California, he isn't sure - but he will ask CEO if I persist. We meet again Monday.

"Well this question has a little different spin.  I was reading the story of this unfortunante user.

That’s so Utterly unfair https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9g3odp/crazy_emergency_room_charge_i_thought_i_did/

I have seen on that thread as well as others themes of “I got the bill reduced to to my income”.  It seemed like a lot more streamlined process.

The problem is I, along with many others, are not “poor” in the traditional sense.  I make 100,000 but still have bills like everyone else. They aren’t crushing and I have a healthy savings.  I still have a family and bills and expenses and can be crushed by a bogus out of network charge.  While the OP got “lucky” and it was only $900, the same scenario could easily play out with higher numbers.

The point I’m making is so people like me get screwed?  I feel like a hospital is not likely to waive charges if you don’t “qualify” due to “making too much”.  In fact I bet the “system” won’t let them.  Should I just understate my income when negotiating with these people to appease the process.

"Hi everyone - first time homebuyer here with many thanks to the info received on this sub. Last December, my husband and I made the decision to make a 10% down offer on a home in Brooklyn, NY - we decided that paying PMI for a bit was preferable to continuing to rent in a high cost of living area. (Apartment cost = $595k, we put down $60k).

&#x200B;

Our mortgage rep was at our closing, which seemed weird since he didn't really have a role - there were a LOT of other people in the room - and since the closing dragged on, we chatted with him about various topics including making extra mortgage payments and how we'd get the PMI removed. He said it would be automatically removed at 78% left to go, or we could call BoA at 80%. I asked him if we'd have to get it re-appraised at that time and he said no.

&#x200B;

For the past 8 mos, we've been making extra payments towards our principal and just this month hit 80% (yay). So I did what the guy said and called BoA... of course it takes like five business days to put it in the system, send us a paper letter, etc, etc - and at that point I find out that not only do they want us to get the place re-appraised, but they want us to pay $500 to have someone do it!

&#x200B;

I actually dug out my notes from the closing and have been sending it up the chain at BoA, but their response has basically been, ""we didn't say that""/""there was a miscommunication.""

&#x200B;

Fortunately, my husband and I make enough $$ to continue to throw more of it at the mortgage, and in about 2 more months we'll be at 78% where I believe they have to remove it automatically.... although who knows, because they've certainly told us incorrect stuff before.

&#x200B;

So - my question to you guys, is there anything else we can do to remove the PMI now? Otherwise, let this be a cautionary tale to people who are considering waiting to save up for the 20%/using BoA as a lender in general..... :(

&#x200B;

EDIT: THANK YOU ALL! This info below has elucidated the PMI removal process far better than any of our useless BoA reps. I went back and looked at my contract again and it looks like we can either a) pay $515 for an appraisal now or b) pay PMI until we hit 75% of original loan price. Our PMI is only $84/month, so we're gonna try to get there in under 5 months to come out ahead.

I'm a 33 yr old guy and I'm at the lowest point in my life. I've been homeless for 2 years and I can't get out. I do not do drugs or drink. My parents were drug addicts and didn't teach me anything about life management as an adult. I have a zero person support system, no family or anyone at all to help anything so I'm by myself as far as looking for advice or help from anyone.
I am a Marine Corps veteran and I have no access to VA funded services because of my discharge. (It's not a dishonorable. It's a lesser grade) I've been to 2 years of college.  I have no mental illness or physical ailments that would effect or cause this situation.

I'm currently married and have 2 kids  4 year old daughter and 6 month old son. My wife lives in a residential program for homeless women and children.  I've been unable to get my shit together and I can't figure out why.
I've owned and lost 2 businesses. I've been a union carpenter, a restaurant manager, catering manager, also a moving company foreman. I've got plenty of experience in many fields. I adapt and excel rapidly at jobs.

Counter to most beliefs it is possible, (I know because I live this life) to have a FULL-TIME job and still be homeless. I am very active and present in my wife and kids life. I generally work between 40 and 55 hours a week and my normal bring home pay is between 500-750 a week.  This is where and what I feel my biggest problems are. I know that I have no financial planning or management ability in my personal life. 
I have a small but significant thing going for me in that I do not have any debts. No credit cards or loans etc. I do not have good credit either though, so acquiring credit cards and financing things is out of the question. 

I live in the Boston area. Rent is ridiculously high here, and most places require first last and deposit and I do no have it.  I have no vehicle as well.
My bills are - 
Cell phone for wife and I.              $102 month
Storage locker.                                   210 month

Laundry.                                              100 month
My largest expenses are 1, food which costs me about 200 a week. I am staying in a storage locker and I can't store food at the place because I don't want to attract pests. And 2, showers, because I don't know anyone at all here, I have to rent hotels once or twice a week to clean myself. I am currently employed at a moving company and I get dirty fast so I stay on top of hygiene.
I have about $500 to my name. 
I've asked local shelters and churches for help. I've found that if you aren't a dopehead or alcoholic, or have some sever mental disability  there is not much help available for you. I've often encountered people who are in these positions to help the homeless and or addicted, often have no clue on how to help me. They don't have any resources or places to help someone who is already doing the right thing. 
So I'm asking for help here. I'm worth it. I'm intelligent hard working and exceptionally capable

"Hello first time posting here. I'm not sure what I'm asking for because I'm just at a complete loss at the moment and need to talk about my situation. I'm 28, married with 2 kids. A 1yo and a 5yo. I'm currently working a salaried position making 32.5k a year plus bonuses of 400-800 a month plus gas compensation (.32 per mile) that equals about 300 a week after I deduct what I'm spending on gas a week. Normally I bring a bit over 3k a month home. We currently live with my wife's mother because she is disabled. I help her with her bills and pay mine and this totals roughly 1.3k a month. So I should be able to save quite a bit a month right....wrong my wife and her mother constantly take money from my joint account (with wife) for dumb stuff (fast food, pictures, non necessities) and lately it's become such a problem that they are over drafting the account to pay for things. Her mother has now recently decided I should be paying every bill in the house instead of our agreed upon splitting when we moved in. When I talk to my wife about it she says we live with her so we should be helping (as stated before I already am paying half of everything) my wife refuses to get a job because of the kids and because I told her she wouldn't have to several years ago (times have changed). I want to get my family away from the mother in law and into our own place but until they stop spending what seems like every cent I have I just can't afford it. 


So to sum it up I'm making more than enough to pay my Bill's but because my wife and mother in law are becoming more and more greedy and lazy with money I'm in serious debt trouble and idk what to do about it. I'm stuck playing catch up at the moment and don't see a light at the end of the tunnel yet. I love my wife and I do not want to leave her so please do not suggest that.

"Hi everyone, I play a game online and “real world trading” is against game rules. I broke the games rules and bought in game “gold” with real money. I paid about $75.00 on my credit card and received the gold, the game company then wrote to me saying they had removed the in game gold and if I did it again my account would be banned. 

I speak to the seller of the gold on Playerauctions.com because he had broke his terms that he laid out which caused me to be caught breaking the rules on this game. The seller refuses to refund me and Playerauctions is not helping. My question is, is it unlawful or immoral for me to call my credit card company and have them refund the money for this charge? Or is there a way I can go about getting my money back?

I have to travel to London 9 days each fortnight to be on site, and work from home (WFH) 1 day in the fortnight, and the season ticket for a month is £850.

Or is it a benefit, that the company pays for my season tickets, in which case I think NICs are due, by the company and personally? But is that still pre corporation tax?

If it was a benefit (perhaps they decided that it was regular commuting and can't count as an expense), then is there still an advantage to having the company pay as a benefit, or does it work out better if I pay personally?

"Hi!

Bit of a strange situation, I’ll try to be straight to the point.

I’ve had a lot of advice already regarding what to do with my house, however looking for more opinions.

I own a 3 bed terrace and I’ve just entered into a 5 year fixture with permission to rent the building out.

My Mum sadly passed recently and I’ve had to move into her house to take ownership of our 2 dogs. Her house is a semi-detached with a big garden which is much better suited for the dogs and mortgage free.

I asked my financial advisor (which I took with a grain of salt) if there was a small penalty free exit period (say within 30 days of the fixture being processed) however he’s said once I’m in - I’m in.

My question boils down to - are the exit fees of a fixture worth paying to avoid the responsibility of renting out my old house? Due to the tax changes being applied to the mortgage as well as the profit, a lot of people I know have started selling their properties they let, as there’s not much profit in it anymore, whereas my financial advisor is saying there is.

I can’t devote time to the house over the next 5 years, as my main focus is the dogs. So if the exit fees aren’t worth paying, should I just rent it out as unfurnished?

I have people interested in already renting my building, one being a close friend in a stable job and think she would be a very good tenant.

"Being a short time lurker I have picked up a few tricks to help me learn to budget in my newness to this sub, but now I am kinda in a pickle. 

So to start off I was rear ended and my car was totaled out last week, they will pick it up this week.
Luckly me and my Fiance have another vehicle to share for a month or so. I am honestly looking at this as a blessing since I got this car when my credit was horrid and my interest rate is out of this world. 

So the insurance company isn't gonna pay off my loan due to the worth being less than whats owed. Thankfully I have GAP insurance which will take the rest. I am wanting a newer car and my price range is 10-15k for me to have the monthly payments I want. I will have $500 to put as a down payment. 

Now comes the problem. My credit was decent until I couldn't pay my student loans. (I just moved states and it really has me behind) so just today have I resolved that by requesting a forbearance. Which if I understood correctly it brings me to current like I never missed a payment due to retroactivating it on my missed month (april). So going off credit karma my score now is 530 (was 670). My fiance is also co signing with a credit score of 640. 

Now my questions:

1. Should I wait until my current car is picked up and my current loan is paid before applying for a new auto loan?

2. Should I wait until the forbearance is accepted and to affect my credit score before applying?

3. Should I apply where I currently have an auto loan, because I have banked with them previously and they might accept my credit score?

4. Not a question, but any advice dealing with auto loans or this situation at all is warmly welcomed. 

Thank you so very much in advance and I am sorry I tend to ramble when my nerves are shot, that translates to text aswell. 

Extra stats you may or may not need:

My yearly income: 27k

Fiance yearly income: 25k


EDIT - Thanks for all the info! So i probably should of put this in, but in my haze I forgot. The reason I am looking for something in this price range is because of a gas economy and reliability. I drive every other weekend to take care of my mother in GA which is 400 miles away. I moved away to for work, and sadly it is cheaper for me to help her than to hire someone. (I rotate with my aunt that lives in FL, she helps the other weekend)

Also remember this is both me and my fiance's car, instead of looking at just 27k look at it as 52k. I shouldn't of differentiated since both sources go to the same account. 

Now with this new info (I should of included) should I still look into a vehicle in that price range?

If not, what should I do with only having about month to save? I have one car and both me and my fiance work, and she goes to school full time still. I tried to carpool when I had a working vehicle, but no one wants to drive out of their way to pick me up.

"Hey guys.

So long story short, I was recently fired (today) from my employer after only being there for 4 (June-September) months. I sent an email with confident client information to the wrong person by accident and was terminated because of it.

While honest, my mistake had the potential to cause material damage to my firm which warranted such an extreme reaction. My colleagues and friends have tried to comfort me by saying that this mistake could have happened to anyone, and that me working 70+ hours a week increased opportunity for error. My manager explicitly stated: “we did not set you up in a position to succeed”.

Emotionally— I still haven’t fully processed what has happened. Mentally— I’m focused on getting a new job as soon as possible and would appreciate some assistance.

My situation is interesting in that I’m not an official college graduate yet, as I’m finishing up 3 credits for a BS in engineering. My employer knew this and still allowed to take me on full time.

My firm is a top tier consultancy located in NYC. During my time there, I was able to gain a wide variety of skills that I think are extremely rare when compared to my peers.

My question to you: should I list this job on my resume— marketing it as an internship instead of a full time hire? Or should I be honest about my full time employment there? Technically, I’m still a student so I have some leeway in this decision making. Alternatively, should I remove the job all together?

My employer has agreed to provide a positive reference. In fact, multiple people from the firm have agreed to reach out to their own networks and assist me in anyway they can.

The biggest obstacle in all of this is that I was Terminated- not let go. How do I rework this into a positive? The HR person from my departing firm told me I should communicate this as a “mutual decision” and part of a “re-structuring”. My take? Companies aren’t that dumb and will be curious as to how a 4 month hire was let go during a re-org.

I would truly appreciate any help on this issue. I just signed a 12-month lease in NYC for $1,500/month, so finding a new job is of great importance

EDIT: thanks for the responses, and everyone who’s offered uplifting advice. 

What I think is being overlooked in this scenario is that I’m technically still a student— my degree will not be not conferred until December. I’ve had multiple internships in the past and absolutely none of my full time interviewers fact checked or even reference checked them. So while being upfront about it would be the safest way to play, I doubt that needing to bring up why I left will be necessary at all. I think most will just *assume* it was an internship. Will my employment with this company come up on a traditional background check?

Regarding the restructuring bit, apparently we were recently bought out by a private equity firm so firings wouldn’t be completely out of the question. I will be touching base with HR today to determine exactly what will be said when/if asked about my employment. 

This entire situation just sucks a lot and I’m still trying to grapple with what happened. Thanks for the help!

"Dear ~~Abby~~ Reddit,

So I have kind of an interesting situation going on right now.  It can only be a good situation for me but would like to reach out to my fellow Redditor's for some help on how to proceed next.  Especially considering that I have already broken the cardinal rule of salary negotiation and gave a number! However, there is a twist in my story that may help negate this, I hope!

&#x200B;

My current employer is a large company, let's call them CurrentCorp.  I do hardware engineering and have been with CurrentCorp for almost five years starting right out of college. I am generally happy with CurrentCorp and have a manager whom I have a great relationship with.  He is the kind of guy that is always out looking for career growth opportunities for his people.  Also, I've developed a pretty good reputation within our engineering group in the past five years so I have that going for me. That being said, CurrentCorp doesn't necessarily have a reputation for paying the highest wages in our industry although they also aren't unreasonably low either.  

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago I was reached out to by another company, let's call them NewCorp. NewCorp is opening a new engineering office in my town (finally some employer competition!). Their job posting was identical to what I do now. Interviews all went well except for when they asked me what my expected salary was. I knew I was supposed to deflect but I broke down almost immediately and gave a range.  It was a well research range but a range nonetheless. The range with about 20-40% of what I make now on base salary, again this is researched and something I thought was fair. Anyways, I got a call back a few days later informing me that the interviews went well and they are extending me an offer but needed some more information before they send out the offer letter (regarding unvested stock and unused sabbatical). I gave them the information and four days later I still haven't heard back. So that is where I am at with NewCorp.  Confirmed offer incoming but not on paper yet (I know, I know...)!

&#x200B;

Back to CurrentCorp.  I think they knew something was up from the very beginning. Word had gotten around that NewCorp was in town doing in-person interviews in a stretch of three days. It sounds like one of our higher ups was diligent enough to keep track of who missed work on those days.  Word is that this resulted in a spreadsheet of people who they may lose to NewCorp.  This all culminated in my manager setting up a meeting with me a sliding me a piece of paper.  It was a promotion and 20% base pay increases + higher bonus (+135%) and stock (+100%). I also was asked to fill a role in our next project where I can directly influence project direction, this is big opportunity for career growth.  It's a good situation. Afterwards, I did let the cat out of the bag and told my manager I had indeed interviewed with NewCorp and they extended an offer. Not sure if it was the smartest thing to do but like I said I have a good relationship with him and it felt like a good organic time to bring it up. What I appreciate the most here is that I didn't have to ask CurrentCorp for a raise.  They saw a risk of me leaving and adjusted promotion and salary accordingly.  Still a bit reactive but thats capitalism right? Not mad at all.

&#x200B;

So the conundrum is this.  I think there is always inherent risk with moving to new company. So any expected salary should be referenced off of current work situation (salary, satisfaction, etc.). Considering this has drastically changed with CurrentCorp, **is it wrong for me to update my expected salary range with NewCorp**?  Normally, this would be a no brainer but the expected salary increase is substantial enough that I worry NewCorp will see it as unreasonable and me wasting their time (I don't want to burn any bridges here.) Or is this the part where I shut the hell up about salary ranges and just mention that situation has evolved with CurrentCorp. Also, considering I haven't received an offer letter from NewCorp, should I let them know sooner than later or wait until first offer letter comes in? (I lean sooner to be more expedient). I think the answer is probably pretty clear but I can use some confirmation from you internet strangers!

&#x200B;

TLDR; Gave expected salary range to prospect employer.  Unsolicited, current employer met those numbers. My expected salary range to leave to leave my current company are now substantially higher.  Should I get back to prospective employer with updated range or do I now shut up and just say situation has changed and leave it at that and see where their offer lands?

"Since my old junker died on me last month, I've been looking at getting a used car. I'm in the central Florida area and have decided on either a '16 corolla or civic.

"I posted about working as a sys admin on r/sysadminjobs...well, I interviewed well and I got an offer. I was advised it is worth $90k. This is what they offered:

*Salary 1*: $60k; 15k options

*Salary 2*: $72k; 5k options

**NOTE**: He said he thought offer was on the lower side, but said since it's an entry level system administration position, my lack of experience, they're kind of a ""start up"", I can work from home (could be argued in my favor), and unlimited vacation he thinks the offer is fair. They take care of my internet, phone bill, computer, office chair/desk, etc. too so that's value there.

I asked if it was negotiable, explained I thought it was more of a System Administrator II or higher position due to the tasks (*some projects listed below*) and I'll be the only person. **I asked for $90k** - which is a comparable salary to someone in a System Administrator II position. I said I could show him research and data (any additional evidence someone wants to post I'm open to it). He said he thought $90k + 0 options might work, but due to the reasons on the ""**NOTE:**"" above, he wasn't sure. I said thank you and said I'll decide over the weekend.

We're reconvening on Monday. If I persist on $90k, he said he'll ask the CEO . I believe my point is within reason and I can achieve $90k. Don't want to let this go though. Do you all think the same I'm within reason?

***TL;DR***: He offered $72k + 5k options, and said it was entry level system administration. I asked for $90k, and said it was more system administration II work (project list below). He said maybe possible, but due to lack of experience, work from home, and not California, he isn't sure - but he will ask CEO if I persist. We meet again Monday. I want to push for $90k, but don't want to lose the offer in full. Thoughts?

"First of all, I am sorry if this may be the wrong sub to ask this question in, but it is the most relevant one I could think of. 

I work for a large scale catering company as a dining room manager and sparingly help my boss in the office when she needs it. My department has about 120 employees currently. 

I am 1 of about ten or so managers and we all work under the department head. She went on vacation for the week and makes about 7$/hr more than me hourly. She had asked me to fill in for her as I have the most office and administrative experience between all of us managers. I agreed since I enjoy helping out when I can and am looking to move up in the company and figured showing what I can do would help. 

I am scared I will come off a little unprofessional asking for a pay increase for this week. I’m also unsure whether I should ask for an hourly pay rate increase or a flat bonus. I make 19$/hr and am full time with benefits. My boss makes 26$/hr. My bonus is usually about 50$/per event. 

This was this past week and I did not really think of it until now. I receive a bonus for every event I manage and have not been able to do any events except for this Saturday since I have worked full time in the office Monday - Friday. I realized I am actually making less as I only get one bonus for this week whereas I would usually get 2-5.

"Hello fellow redditors,

This post will be the inverse of what I typically see in my feed on this subreddit.

I just made this account, so no ties could be made to my personal life, to try to see if anyone can give me some guidance. I am 28 years old and was brought up to the big leagues due to a connection I made with the CEO of a growing company a little over 3 years ago. My first year I brought in a little over 200k, my second yer 280k and this year I will be somewhere between 320k and 340k gross. I am taxed at an extraordinary rate. For example last my I had a good month at 36k gross and took home a little less than 22k. My returns are very very weak as the years go by off memory I had a return of about 3k. I am single and am renting an apartment. 

&#x200B;

As a young man that really never grew up with anything at all, I have been spending money. It's bad but not an atrocity. Right now I have a 140k in savings however am renting a luxury apartment at $3,850 a month. I had 60k in student loans which as the very first thing I paid off. I have a modest car for my income, a infiniti Q50 which is paid in full. I completely debt free.

&#x200B;

Sorry for all of that preamble. My reason why I am reaching out here is because I know that my money can be doing much better out there in the market however my long term goal is to put a very large down payment on a house in roughly a year and a half. The reasoning for this is because even if I lose this position, which I am very much excelling at, I would still be able to float the mortgage. 

&#x200B;

Should I even bother trying to do anything with this month in the what I would think is the short term? Also, does it make sense that a W2 employee that made 280k last year on a straight commission based salary should be getting $4,000 for a tax return even if I am single and don't own a home?

"I am in my late 20s, about to start a new job where I'll actually be making enough money to save and invest for the first time, and this sub has been really helpful to me in figuring out how best to start doing that.  I just want to run my game plan by some folks who obviously know more than me about personal finance to make sure I'm not making any mistakes with my money.

&#x200B;

Here's where I am--

* My new job won't make me wealthy by any means, but the (pre-tax) $45k plus sales commission is a good bit more than I'm used to having.
* My monthly bills (rent, cell phone, parking pass, etc) total about $1400. I also have zero debt (!!!) so I've got a pretty clean slate to work from.
* My new employer is a small startup that does not yet offer retirement benefits for its employees, so most of my research has been in regard to how I should begin saving for retirement. I just opened a Vanguard Roth IRA with the intent of rolling over my retirement funds into this account since I do not have an option through my employer. I don't think I can afford the max contribution of $5500/year yet, but I'm going to try for half that to start with and do more if I can.
* The vast majority of my current retirement savings is with the Virginia Retirement System (VRS). I had VRS's [Hybrid Plan](https://www.varetire.org/pdf/publications/hybrid-handbook.pdf). I was 50% vested when I left so am eligible to roll over a total of $6086 (\~$1370 from my 401a, and the rest from my member contribution account and 457).
* I have a laughable amount (just under $150) in my Fidelity 401k with my soon-to-be former employer, so I'll roll that over too.
* I'm currently using [Digit](https://digit.co) to save towards my emergency fund and a few short term goals (travel, etc).  I like it because I am forgetful and Digit does the work for me.

&#x200B;

Here are my biggest questions--

1. I'm a little murky on the [tax implications](https://www.varetire.org/pdf/publications/irs-402f.pdf) of rolling over my other retirement accounts into the Roth IRA, so if anyone could ELI5 I would really appreciate it.
2. When I try to initiate a rollover to my Vanguard Roth IRA on Fidelity's website from my (very meager) 401k, I get the message ""There are no rollovers available to you at this time.""  Why would this be?  The first thing they asked me was whether my address on file was current (it wasn't), then it took me directly to a screen with the message I just described. Could it really be that I am getting this message just because they have the wrong address on file for me? (UPDATE: I answered my own question, it's the address thing.  Just emailed HR asking them to get with it. They're useless so we'll see.)
3. Right now I have a conservative investment portfolio with Acorns.  It's at about $170 and I've committed $100 a month to it, can probably increase that amount once I start my new job. Knowing that I am a complete novice, is this as good a place as any to start an investment portfolio, or am I making a mistake? What should I do?  (I have a trusted family friend who is a financial adviser and was an amazing steward of my parents' investments over the years -- she is the reason I have no student loans -- but everything I have read here has told me to avoid using a financial adviser even though my first inclination was to go to her for help.)
4. I know my annual contribution limit to my Roth IRA is $5500. For my first year, do the funds I am rolling over count towards this? Or can I invest an additional $5500?

"Hello PF. I've seen lots and lots of posts around here about housing questions, buying, selling, all that fun stuff. And I've noticed that there isn't anything particularly helpful on that topic in the sidebar, so I figured why not, I can contribute. Background: I'm a licensed Mortgage Loan Originator in the US, with licenses in 6 states. So anyway, about buying a house!

Your house is the largest single investment most people will make in their lifetime. And yet, the vast majority of people have absolutely no idea how this whole thing works. If you were paying attention, you probably know that the 2008 recession had something to do with housing and something or something, but that's a topic for a whole different time and another sub. People's knowledge generally stops at making payments on time and everyone got screwed on their interest rate. So let's try to learn something about the way this whole thing works.

So you want to buy a house. Congratulations! There's a LOT of stuff that you need to be thinking about and every single person you talk to is going to have an opinion or a way to help. But no matter who you talk to, the first question you'll get is always ""What's your rate?"" Gonna be honest, as an MLO, I absolutely hate that question. I could tell you the rate is 3.5%, I could tell you it's 7.5%, but what does that actually mean for you? Most people don't really have a point of reference for it. I understand why everyone cares, but there's a TON of stuff that goes into it. We'll get to rates later. Yes, it's a fair question, but it's not at all the most important thing.

The first thing you should actually be asking is this: How can I get a pre-qualification letter? The vast majority of the time, to actually make an offer on a house, they'll ask you for some sort of evidence that you actually have the money to buy the house. If you don't happen to have $250,000 lying around somewhere, you'll probably need to borrow it, so they want to see proof that you're actually qualified to borrow that much money. That's what the pre-qualification is for. It also helps you with figuring out exactly what your price range is.

So, we're trying to get you pre-qualified, that's fantastic! A couple of very important steps are coming into play here. How much of a down payment do you have saved up? The ""traditional"" wisdom is 20% of the house, but... That's a *ton* of money and a lot of people just aren't able to get that much saved up very easily. If that's you, there are other options available. If you're a veteran or active duty in the military, you can actually finance 100% of the house. The same is also true if you live in a metropolitan statistical area of under 20,000 people. Financing 100% of the house isn't exactly ideal and it'll bring your payment up quite a bit, but we can do it. If you don't fall in to one of those two categories, like most people, you *must* bring at least 3.5% as a down payment, no matter what. Gifts are allowed, but if it's a gift, you have to have a notarized letter saying that there's no expectation of it to be repaid. Otherwise, you have to be able to prove that you've had the money for at least two months. So, to summarize: How much should you bring for a down payment? As much as possible, but at *least* 3.5%. The more, the better.

Okay, awesome, you have a down payment! The next thing we're going to do is get you credit qualified. That's easy, right? Eh.... Not quite. It's not quite as simple as just checking your credit score, although that is a part of it. As long as you're above ~650, there won't be a problem with the score. But just to make it more complicated, your Credit Karma score isn't going to really help you. It's been tossed around a little bit, but mortgage companies use a different scoring equation. So it's fantastic if Credit Karma tells you that you have a 750, but if I pull your credit and see a 550, I can't help you. That's an extreme example, but I've seen differences of up to 100 points between the calculation methods. Beyond just the credit score, there are also things on the credit report that we need to see. No bankruptcies discharged in the last two years.  (Side note, if you're in the middle of a chapter 13, we can still help you. It might be worth looking into.) We don't *like* collections, but those are case-by-case and we usually ignore medical collections (mostly). As far as late payments go, all we really care about is late payments on the mortgage. If you have a mortgage right now, you have to be current on it. But if you've been late more than twice in the last 12 months, our investors don't want us to take that risk. If your credit score is below 650, it just means you need to shop around a little bit. My last company, for example, was able to lend down to 620 or even 600 with some circumstances. Your local bank might be able to lend on even lower credit scores. It just depends. 

And while we're on the topic of credit, time for a second about credit pulls. The CFPB has actually put a rule in place stating that after a mortgage company makes a credit pull, you can have every other mortgage company in the country pull your credit and after 45 days, it'll all only count as 1 credit pull. You have a 45 day window for free pulls, you may as well use it and shop around while you can.

Okay, great, so you have a down payment and you have your credit qualification. Next step, income! You do have an income, right? Yes, I have actually run into problems with this one before... You HAVE to have an income that reports to the government. If the federal government doesn't know about it, we can't use it. So you 1099 folks, be careful how much you're writing off for business expenses. That can affect how much income we're allowed to use to qualify you. Now, how much do you need? So conventional budget-building recommends that you should keep your housing expenses right about 30% of your budget. Fun fact, when it comes to the mortgage, that's the actual rule. It depends on the mortgage program, but your housing expenses aren't allowed to be more than ~28-36% of your monthly income, although some exceptions occur. In addition, your TOTAL debt-to-income ratio has to be under 45%. Your income is one of the limiting factors for your monthly payment.

Okay, so we've already got a lot of the stuff we need to know. Your down payment, your credit qualification, and your income gives us benchmarks for what your payment limits are. There are **6** pieces of information that we need to give you an accurate rate. If anyone is trying to quote you a rate before getting all six pieces of information, be very skeptical of it. It probably won't be accurate. Those six pieces of information: The loan vs the value of the house (LTV), the amount of the loan, the income you're able to use, your credit score, the loan program you're using, and what the purpose of the loan is (in this case, a purchase). Right now, rates are typically in the 4-5% range, *mostly* on the lower end of that. Obviously, though, your mileage may vary.

Okay, now for my mini-rant about why rate doesn't actually matter. On a $100,000 loan, a 10 year note at 10% is $1,321 per month. A 30 year note for the same amount at 3.5% is $449 per month. Over the lifetime of the loan, though, the 10 year costs about $158,000 while the 30 year costs $161,000. A .125% change in interest rate on the same 30 year note is a difference of $8/month and about $2500 over the life of the loan. It's not nearly as important as people think it is. Not saying it doesn't matter at all, but that 4% vs that 4.125% isn't quite as big a difference as people think. The difference maker is actually the term of the loan.

A $100,000 loan at 4% for 10 years costs you $1,012 per month with a total lifetime repayment of $121,494. The same loan over 30 years is only $477 per month, but you'll end up paying $171,870 before the house is paid off. Extending the loan out 20 years saves you about $750 every month but costs you $50,000 over the life of the loan (spoiler alert, you end up ahead by about 20 years' of payments on the 30 year). What I recommend to people, for the most part is this: Go with the 30 year note, then make extra payments. Why? Because no mortgage since 2008 has prepayment penalties (unless you have a *really* shady bank) and mortgage interest is simple interest, instead of compounding. That's right, mortgage interest does *not* earn interest on itself. Your mortgage interest for the year is calculated at the beginning of the year and scheduled out throughout the year. Every penny you pay over your minimum payment is money paying down the principal of the loan. This makes mortgages one of the easiest loans to pay ahead on. That's why I personally tend to recommend going with a 30-year, then paying ahead when you can. That way, you have the lowest possible payment if something were to happen, but you can afford to throw a ton of extra money at it while you're able to.

Okay, so we have your credit, we have your rate, we have the program, all the structures of the loan, all that fun stuff, we're almost done right? Kinda... Next step is the appraisal. If we're going to lend you money on your house, we need to know how much your house is *actually* worth. I've seen a lot of people really not understand what the appraisal is about. It has nothing to do with how recently you put your roof on, how recently you painted, if you recently replaced a door, none of that stuff. The appraisal is based on the prices of houses in the neighborhood and what they *actually sold for*. The appraiser will do some adjustments because not all houses are identical, but it all depends on what your neighbors are selling their houses for. (There are other ways to do appraisals, this is the most common.) And this is where you start to get into all the fees associated with buying a house. Title work, inspections, origination fees, surveys, HOA fees, all that fun stuff. There's a lot of it, but I'll save that for another post because this one is already getting long. Just... Be prepared to need anywhere from $2-5000 dollars to cover the ""closing costs"" of buying a house. I promise, the fees all make sense and none of them are meaningless, it's just expensive.

So congratulations! You now own a home and owe on a debt for 15-30 years of your life. I'll put up another post about the closing costs and what all goes into that at a later date. Until then, be an educated consumer.",109,1536978944.0,personalfinance,9fukac,373,Introduction to Buying a House,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9fukac/introduction_to_buying_a_house/
"Disclaimer: I'm pissed off beyond belief and I'm sure this reads like a bad screenplay or something but I did the best I could while typing this on mobile.

Note: The car we purchased was a 2019 Honda HRV Sport. I do realize the factory in Mexico just sustained damage from a storm that may be the cause of some of this delay. However, after finding out that we've been lied to multiple times I still feel they should take responsibility for this. 

Full story in chronological order:

Aug 20: USAA set us up with 3 different dealerships for a car we wanted through their car buying service. We'll call them dealership A,B, and C.

Aug 23: My wife and I go to Honda dealership A (the one near us that has been servicing my current Honda for 3 years. I've had nothing but excellent experiences from their service department and they have home field advantage so I really wanted to give my business to them. We test drive the car we want but tell the guy up front we don't plan to buy tonight because I have to compare. I ask him for a price so I can compare to other dealerships and he begrudgingly gives us a number. (""We don't like to give out numbers because someone will just undercut us by $100."" Etc, etc.) We go home and sleep on it. 

Aug 24: We feel good about the price but still check the other two remotely. Dealership B doesn't have the car we want and Dealership C gives an out the door price through email that he ""cannot go any lower than"" and it's $1000 over what the first dealership told us the night before so we obviously go with dealership A.

I called dealership A to find out about getting the car in the color we want. The senior sales manager asks what color we want and then tells me they have one already ordered for the dealership and we're in luck. We wouldn't need to order one just for us and it would probably be there in 3-5 days. He then tells us to ""come lock it down so someone else doesn't get it.""

That evening we decide to purchase the car. We sit down to negotiate and the salesman tried to hit us with an $800 higher price than he originally quoted us. I call him on it and he then tries to claim it's everything under the sun from a ""delivery fee"" to some other shit I can't even remember. We threaten to walk out and he drops the price to what he said before which is also the MSRP. Only thing left I wasn't happy with was a $640 document fee that I know we don't have to pay but I'm pretty frustrated at this point and just say fuck it. I write a check for $10.7k and finance the rest ($14k). The very last thing I'm told as we stand up is ""and our sales manager says he spoke to you on the phone earlier and said he told you it would be here on September 8."" I tell the guy that he most certainly did not tell us that it would be over two weeks away and this is bullshit but he doesn't care at all and I'm pissed so whatever. He mentions it's possible that it may come sooner and so we hope for the best. 

Aug 25 - Sep 7: Nothing from anyone. Not a hello, fuck you, sorry it's taking so long, or anything. But they had no problem cashing my almost $11k check. 

Sep 8: By 3pm we still hadn't heard anything. Call the dealership and neither our salesman nor the senior sales manager is at work. I finally get transferred to the assistant sales manager and after expressing my frustrations (I'm very polite and I don't believe in screaming at people. Especially when they had nothing to do with it.) he agrees to remove the document fee of $640 to compensate for the delay but is sure that it will be there on Monday (2 days away) because they do not receive deliveries on Sundays. I tell him that I greatly appreciate his efforts to making this right. 

Sep 10: No one has made the effort to get up with me first so I text the salesman I dealt with at 11 informing him that we were getting the document fee removed and new paperwork drawn up when we come up to collect our vehicle today. He texts back that he'll keep an eye out for the car and keep us posted. We don't hear anything back so we text him at 5. No dice. 

Sep 11: I text the salesman around 10 and he says hopefully it'll come in today, that this never happens, and sorry but it'll all be worth it. I call him at 11 and politely ask him what he can do about it and he says there is nothing they can do. Its the trucking companies fault and not theirs. I politely tell him I understand this but I also work in sales and I know that when our company messes up or inconveniences someone they do whatever they can to make it right. He refused to budge. He then tells me they got an update from the trucking company and the latest it will be here is the 14th. 

Around 12 I call USAA and they inform me that the loan is active and there is no cancelling it. The dealership would have to cut us a check for the full amount and we would have to close the loan, wait however long that takes, open another loan, and hit our credit twice in two-ish weeks just to go somewhere else to buy the car. Not to mention that our money has been tied up with this dealership the whole time and our time has been wasted. 

Sep 12-13: I variously text the salesman for updates because I receive no contact from them otherwise. Car is not there. 

Sep 14: Same as the last two days. My wife and I decide to go to the dealership around 530 to talk to someone in person. The salesman is there and he gets the assistant sales manager that helped me over the phone the week before. He sits down and politely tells us there is nothing they can do. He then tells me the earliest the car could have ever been there was the 12th and no one should have told me the 8th. He called this a mistake but we feel like we've been lied to. He tells us the window is from the 12th to the 19th. I was told a solid date two times and never told a window. Again, we feel like we've been lied to. He mentions something about them having checked other dealers close by to get one from them but they don't have it. I told him that the one that's 25 minutes down the road has it and wants my business right now. He shrugs. I ask him about getting our money back and he says no one will be able to do that until Monday, two days away. I  then ask him ""so, there's literally nothing we can do right now? We don't have a car and you have our money?"" He politely admitted that was correct. We walk out pissed. 

Sep 15: Not a peep from them all day. 

I'm begging for any good advice here. I'm not normally the person that will nickle and dime someone but I absolutely feel that we deserve some sort of compensation for this. Even if we do cancel this shit I definitely believe we deserve something for our inconvenience. This is unacceptable. We are okay with the price on the car so ideally we'd like to see this through since we've waited this long but we think we're owed something more at this point. 

I feel sure that there's no way we could get a lawyer involved without having it cost us more than it's worth.

The good news is I recently moved back home, so my expenses have been reduced to  debts due each month, my car payment, car insurance, gas, and food.  My credit score dropped from 800-600. I am denied for debt consolidation loan for credit cards or for balance transfer fees.

* 33000 Credit Card Debt (65k credit lines) - rates from 15-20% right now
* 10000 Car Loan at 3.5% (2016 Jeep Cherokee)

**About me:**

25 years old

Income: 96,400/year

Monthly net income: 5,500

Monthly expenses: 4,300

403(b) savings: 18,000

Cryptocurrency current value: 6,500

Current debt: 18k

Credit score: 612 (100% due to high utilization)

**Key** **Assets:**

Watch: $13,000

Car equity: $2,000

**Considerations**

\- The watch has sentimental value to me

\- I have \~6 months to come up with the money, I'm not in a huge rush

\- My mother would likely agree to loan me the money

\- Despite the \~1,200/month spending money I have, a lot of this goes into unexpected bills (car maintenance, medical bills, etc.) so while the obvious route is to ""just start saving"" - I'm confident that this isn't a practical way to get there.

\- My crypto portfolio went from \~100k to \~6500, and I'd prefer to wait until it rebounds just enough to pay off my credit card debt. I see this as hedging against my debts; which will raise my credit score, while eliminating my debt, if in fact the crypto market rebounds to even 1/3 of what it once was. I'm prepared to wait 2 years for this to happen, and have already taken out more money than I've put in to the market, so I'm at a net gain.

&#x200B;

**My thoughts** (in order of my preference)

\- Take a loan from myself out of my 403(b)

\- Try to find a loan company that would loan me the full amount (flawless credit in all ways EXCEPT utilization %)

\- Wipe out cryptocurrency portfolio, leaving me with $18k of debt (would probably set up debt consolidation)

\- Save $3000 over the next 6 months, and sell belongings to cover the rest

\- Sell my watch, and downgrade the model to a less expensive model

"Hi there. 

I have this idea in my head of what to do for the next 2 years. I want to attempt to go for it, but i am also wary that this is an emotional decision that shouldn't be taken lightly. So, here goes.  TLDR: I am a single data scientist making 78k a year and I want to move to austin and see if i can buy a house when I get there. 

Here is my reasoning. 

I am 31, soon to be 32, single. Recently debt free. Currently have 3k in retirement but am now contributing to the match (6%) am  maxing out Roth IRA, and doing some other stuff. 

I like my job and I like my company.  I feel i am a bit underpaid, but have been able to deal with this since I am learning. Here is my current situation:

Income: 78k per year, 4700$ take home per month
Rent: 720$
Food ~300

Retirement saving 1000 - > 3000$

Other savings. Currently I am saving for some trips, emergency fund, and a car, but I am going to ramp that up later this year to eventually 3000 at least. 

However, for the longest time I have been considering a move to Austin. The home prices there are lower than compared to DC, SF, LA, and NYC. I could save up 60k in two years, put a down payment on a 15 year loan, get a tech job making over six figs, rent that sucker out (or airbnb), and be sitting pretty. Like I could have a paid for house in less than 10 years. Shit, I could even rent the rooms out and practically be fire. 

Also Austin seems to have things I like. I hear it is younger and less family focused (I am 31 but I plan to stay single for a while and am not really family oriented). Location of the Austin GP. Tech Scene. Texas Taxes. 

But like. I am sooo hesitant to pull the trigger on this since it means I would put less into securities to save up for a down payment. This means less into a nest egg I could draw down from. Since more securities means more returns.  I don't know if I will like austin until I move there.  I  wouldn't move and get a job. I would get a job first and then move. 

I also don't need to wait to save up to do this. I could move there sooner and rent and save. But I like my company. 

Argh decisions decisions. I do want a change but I am hesitant. Anyway, I am wondering does anyone have any thoughts on this?",10,1537099267.0,personalfinance,9g7r9c,1,Should I save up to move to Austin?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9g7r9c/should_i_save_up_to_move_to_austin/
"[Letter from Dept of Education](https://i.imgur.com/TPIFNKS.jpg)

[Specific loan information](https://i.imgur.com/7s2j57l.jpg)

I posted about this awhile ago and got some good information, but in the process of my recovery from heroin addiction had some more pressing financial issues to tackle first. However, my situation is a bit  different today...now my court fines are all paid up, I manage a Sober Living house so have much cheaper rent, just got a raise to $15 an hour at my warehouse job, and am beginning some chemical dependency courses at CSU East Bay to become a drug and alcohol counselor, so I'm on a relatively solid path.

As such, I'm finally ready to get my loans out of default and begin paying them down. They are almost all from 2012 when I was at Berkeley, before dropping out due to my relapse at the time. I have never made a payment, and all were done through the Dept of Education. Last year was the first year I had income and filed a tax return in about 5 years, and they took my refund of about $1000, but I don't see where that's reflected in my debt. I have a number of loans, and on the notice I recently received it says with the fees and interest, altogether I owe just over $40k.

So what I'm wondering is, since they apparently just sent it to a private collection agency, can I still do things like rehabilitation or consolidation through the Dept of Education? Would it be better to pay off some of the smaller loans individually, or consolidate them all? It looks like I have different interest rates on some versus others. How would consolidation change my interest rate? Would it be best to try and pay off the high interest loans first? Finally, I'd like to avoid them seizing my tax refund again next year, and while I'd likely put most of it toward my debt anyway, would prefer to do it on my terms. Any advice here is greatly appreciated.",3,1537098852.0,personalfinance,9g7pth,4,"Defaulted student loans, was preparing to begin process to get back on track but I guess they have sent them to collections; what now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9g7pth/defaulted_student_loans_was_preparing_to_begin/
"I recently purchased a used (almost new) car and got it financed through the dealer. I have the money to pay it immediately, but the only reason I didn't buy with a cashier's check on the day-of is that I had to consolidate it from various sources, which would take some time along with getting a certified check from my online bank, and the car was being offered at the best deal in the area by a mile.

I originally planned to pay off the loan on the first bill, but the financing office ""suggested"" I stretch it out over about 6 months. According to this gentleman, very short-term loans such as this could potentially show up strangely in a credit report--something about looking like a totaled vehicle, or not ""counting,"" or something. Is this just one of the other BS things I had to wade through, and an attempt to at least get a little bit of profit from the interest, or is there some truth to this? My instincts scream the former, but I can't seem to find an answer either direction.

Some more background: the money is now sitting in a high-yield account, so I don't expect to pay more than about $200 ""extra"" in interest in this timespan, if my math is right. I'm 27. It's my only installment loan (and debt for that matter). Everything else in my credit history is just 3 fully paid credit cards, though it does seem like the rate I received for the car loan (5%) is about the lowest anyone would give me--my bank is known for great rates and even they couldn't do any better than the financing office. 750ish credit score. I also have a prepayment fee up to $75 before 6 months, so the way the interest shakes out, I should either pay in full *now* or wait until the 6 months are up, again by my math.

**TL;DR** It's been suggested I take at least 6 months to pay my auto loan, lest paying it off early potentially show up strangely on my credit report.

"I have a 2005 Saturn Ion that was passed down to me from my grandmother. I replaced the transmission two years ago, and today I found out that it needs to be replaced again despite my diligence to maintenance. I can't afford to replace the part or to replace the car. 

I have been at my current job for almost four years. Right now I live about 17 miles away from my store. The county my store is located in only offers public transportation on weekend days from 10AM to 5PM. I am in a middle-management role and very close (6 months-1 year) to receiving a store of my own to manage myself. Without a car, there is virtually no way for me to get to work other than using Uber (which would cost anywhere from $50-65 a day.)

I make approximately $1500 a month, after taxes. I currently live in an apartment with two other roommates. I pay $600 for rent, plus around $170 in utilities. My commute leaves me paying around $220 for gas on a monthly basis. The remaining $510 goes to food and other purchases. 

Currently I have no emergency fund or extra savings. 

The way I see it, I have two options: 

1. Quit my job and find a new one (or two) close enough to my apartment that I can walk/take the bus in my county. Doing so, I effectively lose the payoff to my career plan that has been in motion my entire adult life. This plan also requires an extremely (and possibly unrealistically) quick turnaround between jobs.

-OR-

2. Discuss with my family moving in with them, and continuing to pay rent on the apartment I would no longer live in since my name is on the lease. If I move in with my family my mom can drive me to/from work 3/5 days of the week (something she has done for me before.) The lease to my apartment is up in 3 months, and after that I can save up for a new car to replace mine.

So my question is this: are there other options for me outside of the two that I'm seeing? And if not, which is better for me in the long run?

"I’m looking for opinions and suggestions on cutting down my budget expenses. In the past two years I’ve paid off $5000 in credit card debt and still have 2000 to go. I have about $20,000 in student loan debt. I’m really trying to slim down my monthly expenses in order to make larger payments on money owed, so here’s my situation:

I drive an hour each day to work at least five days a week in an SUV that gets in less than 20 miles per gallon. On my last billing statement I spent over $550 just in gas. I currently owe more than the suv is worth so for now I’m not considering selling. I am however debating purchasing an older, used Prius or similar vehicle, which would get many more miles per gallon and save me at least a few hundred a month in gas. The only catch would be financing another vehicle for about $100 a month and I’m not sure if that would be a wise move while already having other outstanding debts.

For instance I’m looking at a very used ‘04 Prius for about $4,500. Given my situation I would still have to finance this and could probably get a 48 month loan for about $75/mo. Total loan cost $5,500. 

Commute to work is 110mi round trip. In my current car this costs me about $550 a month in gas. If I took the Prius every day for a month at about 45mpg (mostly highway) it would currently cost me $162. Theoretically this would save me about $380 a month, minus the payment = $305. This is money I could put towards paying off the pesky CC debt. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or made a similar purchase and benefited from it? My thought is that saving that few extra hundred dollars a month would help me pay off outstanding debts and in the long run be a wise investment.

When I do the math this seems to be a good idea. Within a year I could sell my other car and break even, or if I’m able to transfer work closer to where I live I could just sell the Prius.

"Hey Reddit. I saw a couple posts in this sub and thought it would be good to ask the question here and get some advice or at least find some sanity.

I'm 32 and doing well on my own. Im not rich but I can afford a small townhome and a car and a few moderately nice things. Mom and dad were basically retired. I say ""basically"" because Dad stopped working at 62 and mom hasn't worked since I was younger than 6. They started collecting social security a little bit early. They moved in 2013 from Colorado to Forida then in 2016 from Florida to Arizona and bought a house with cash. Dad was going to fix it up but passed away suddenly last year in December... He was 64. Mom is 65 now. 

Here's my challenge. She owns her single family house and her car, both paid off. She has zero debt as far as I am aware and has no lease of any kind. She has some cash in the bank (I think somewhere upwards of $100k). Overall, she is in ok shape financially, but she only has an income of $1025 a month from social security. That's enough to live on, but things are going wrong with the house, and I'm concerned about all the future unknowns.

We drove back down from Colorado last week and got home to a broken air conditioner. Thank goodness she has an evaporative cooler which has saved us, but doesn't cool nearly as well as AC. A couple people came out and said it needs replacing and quoted us about $7k for replacement (it's a package unit from 2001). All the appliances are old. House was built in 1982. 

My main concern is her life long term. She is plenty capable of working and I keep mentioning that she should find a part time job, and when we are out and about giving her little nudges like ""oh this would be a fun place to work"" hoping she will make a conscious effort to find something. It doesn't have to be much or for many hours a week, but I want her to be self-sustaining while she can and while I'm still trying to establish my life (I just bought my first house in July so I have that to deal with). 

Ultimately, I'd appreciate any advice for things she can do to save money in a state like Arizona. Any ideas for work she can do to pull in a few hundred dollars a month, something other than retail would be ideal. Any recommendations at all for those who have been in a similar situation. I'm fully prepared to take care of mama but don't want to have to do that just yet.

"Over the past 5 years, I had to max out all of my credit cards (\~$55k total) due to divorce, custody battles, medical bills, job loss, relocation,more medical bills, etc.  I had to cash out my IRA several years ago to make the minimum payments on the cards, but that only kept me afloat for about a year (and now I have no retirement - I'm in my 40's).  I have 5 credit cards, and every month I make the minimum payment on each because that's all I can afford to pay, but the interest due on each one is around what the minimum is, so I'm essentially just paying only interest every month and can't pay down the actual debt at all.  I still have a decade of paying child support to my ex, and I live in an expensive area of the country due to my job, which pays decently for my profession, and I need to be near my kids so I can't move to somewhere cheaper.  My credit score is 580, and I couldn't even get a $1k loan from my bank last month to pay for emergency car repairs.  I own my car (10-year old clunker), and rent my house, so I have no real collateral or other assets.  I have no emergency fund, and only have a few hundred dollars on hands each month for discretionary spending.  I've worked up a budget and am living as frugally as I possibly can, but there's just no way for me to ever pay off these cards due to the high interest and balances.  What's my next option?  Bankruptcy?

So about 2 years ago I started a path to getting good credit. I got my vantage to peak at 685 before it going completely downhill last year when I was laid off. At the start of January my score was a 350. I’ve since gotten a new job and today my vantage stands at a 590TU and 578EQ. I have  2 credit cards totaling a debt of a little under 3k that I’d like to consolidate as “good debt” in the form of a personal loan. Are there any loan companies out there that will loan $3k to someone with scores as low as mine?

"Before I start, I know the difference between credit and debit. I just recently started building my credit, and with my one card have raised my credit score 76 points in like, a month (I had no cards before, didn't go over my limit when the utilization was reported).

What I'm curious about is this: in order to build good credit, one should utilize as little of their available credit as possible, as long as they use it at all. Which means that any other expenses should come from cash or a debit card. Credit cards offer a lot more control and safety over your money, whereas debit expenses are hard to claim as fraudulent and actually get money back from--in general, I'd feel more comfortable being able to use credit for all my expenses.

Do you fine folks have any wise words of advice on how to ensure that my money stays exactly where it should and can only be used by me, anytime I'm not using my credit card? I don't typically use my card for online purchases that I'm not confident are safe- stuff like Amazon, bills, and the occasional food delivery are about all I use it for, beyond in person purchases.

I've had an issue with Wish.com charging me multiple times, and never got my money back, so since then I've been careful of where I type my info.

Would it be best to transfer as much of my direct deposit into savings *first*, then move only what I need into checkings? I plan to open a separate savings account that I won't carry a card around for- would it be wise to throw my money into such an account, withdrawing when needed?

"My wife and I have been discussing when to save for a house under the Prime Directive and I am curious what people think. Right now it feels like a moot point because houses in Utah seem to start ~300k in areas we would consider, but advice is welcome. 

Current debt:
 14k in debt on a car (2.5%interest), 
120k in federal student loans (6%), 
8k in private loans (5%)

However, I am in PSLF and have 6 years left to absolve my Fed loans. For my purposes, I assume 22k in payoff debt plus $160/month payment for 6 years since tackling my loans any other way feels like a Herculean task. 

Assets:
4K in cash
36k in 401k
2 vehicles, a 2011 Chevy Malibu paid off and a 2012 Toyota Sienna (14k loan). 

We live with my recently widowed father and pay his utilities (~300/month). I make ~70k/year and we have two young kids. 

Where should I be on the Prime Directive? I think our goal should probably be to save 6 months of expenses assuming my dad asked us to move out at some point, pay off the private loan and the car, and then work on a house down payment. My wife thinks we should go for 3 months expenses, but then save a down payment before paying off other debts because housing prices have gone up in Utah over 10% annually for several years.

In about a year I'll be in a place where I could get an condominium if I feel inclined.

I’m in the running for a huge promotion at work ($5 more per hour, guaranteed full time, 4 weeks PTO, health insurance, money to put into a 401k, and respect in my field) but the job is an hour and forty minutes away from a house I *just* purchased for $30,000. On a good day. Not during the horrible winter we experience for 4-5 months out of the year. 

I want to be able to say I’m willing to relocate and really pursue this career. 

But I’ve been fixing this house up, it’s my first house, haven’t even moved in yet. I have sentimental attachment to it because a. I’m fixing it up *exactly* how I wanted it because I thought I’d be there for a while, b. I’ve been working very hard towards buying my first house for the last five years, and c. all my friends and family live within a half hour of this house. 

This job promotion is exactly what I want my career to be, short of a fantasy life. But the house is a huge goal realized for me. 

My initial gut feeling is to to buy another $30,000-$45,000 house close to the new job, make small repairs but nothing too involved, rent out my first house out (ideally to a close family member or friend so that my husband and I could drive up on days off to see everyone), and see what happens. 

The thought behind it is that if we owe around $80,000 in mortgages, but plan on one house being paid for by a friend or family, our mortgage/utilities will sit around $500-$700 max on the other-closer-to-work-house. 

Renting seems like the wrong move for me because it’s going to be roughly $680-$1,000 depending on what we can find. And I don’t feel like I’ll ever get that back. But if I sell the house I’ll get some money back (yes, no?) And renting means smaller living spaces, living like a sardine, and no control to rip horrible carpet out/paint/take horrible wallpaper down, etc. 

What’s the best move?

I've been wanting to buy a car going into this school year, and I do plan on staying where I am after college (or at least on the mainland; I'm from Hawaii) so it makes a little more sense than it would if I were going back home after college, however...

* I know not to buy a new car. It's definitely nice but pretty much all the features I ""want"" can be added on for relatively cheap on an older car.
* I do know the ""ideal"" payments would be something you could afford after a 20% down-payment + 4-year financing. I was looking into an 8th gen (2006-2011) Honda Civic since they have a fairly good reputation for being reliable, it's the car I drive right now, and would be something  I could afford. If not those then probably a Corolla/Camry/Accord.
* However, I recently got two speeding tickets... I know those will raise how much I pay for insurance but one of them is more serious and on top of some family medical bills I need to take care of, both will pretty much blow through everything I saved up for my car...
* I should be making 800-1000/mo for my college job
* It isn't essential for me to get a car yet, but again I do plan on staying in the area after college and I'm pretty much stuck to my apartment or campus without a car..

So I Just accepted an offer for 70k in southern California. In total there is myself, my wife, and our 2 children(6yr old and 10mo old) in our home; currently I am working while my wife takes care of our 10mo old. We will be moving from +5 hours away, in state. I am set to start the new job in the middle of next month; putting in my 2 week notice with my current company around the 1st of the month. We have ~2000 in credit card debt; 2 credit cards, 1 with a lower limit through my bank and 1 with a higher limit through cap1. I owe 13.6k on my vehicle and make a 341/mo payment(this is min payment, I've paid nothing to the principal); 72mo loan from 2016, 8.61% APR also through cap1.  No student loans or any other major payments/purchases other than rent. My credit score is 650. Wife has a joint account tied directly to my main bank account, no credit cards, no debt, and a credit score of 550.

I only have a few hundred in savings. Not enough to pay for the move plus the deposit and 1mo rent for the new place; currently renting, not looking to buy. Our current rent is $1400/mo vs the 17-1900 we will be moving into. In addition to the need to purchase a whole new wardrobe for my role, I will be driving my personal vehicle for everyday commute. So there is the possibility of having to purchase a used vehicle for my wife to use of we don't live within walking distance of schools. The new job is better, more consistent(salary vs hourly), pay than my current job.

Is it wise to take a large enough personal loan to consolidate my cc debt, pay off my car, and give myself some breathing room with the move and transition? Or would it be better to refi my car separately and take out a smaller loan to cover just the cc debt and a small cushion to facilitate the move?

"So. I just transferred to a university about two weeks ago. My parents encouraged me to live at home to save money, so I never really looked into housing options. The only trouble is that the shortest commute by bus ends up taking two hours each way, and I already have a long day of studying and classes on campus. By the time I get home I'm burnt out and it's dark out and I have no time for homework. My counselor told me she's worried my commute will threaten to make me fall behind academically. 

A few friends of mine had another friend that was looking for another housemate. The rent is $550/mo. + $80 for utilities and the commute would be 7 minutes from campus. I really love the feel of the place and the girls who live there. It felt really natural when I first considered moving in with them. 

However since I initially was going to be living at home when I submitted my fasfa form, I didn't receive any aid for housing. I sent in a request for a change in living-arrangement that will potentially qualify me for housing aid, however interest rates for a loan through the SELF Loan or Wells Fargo would be lower, so I decide to do that. My dad agreed to co-sign the loan with me, and said that he was positive it would get approved if he co-signed so it wouldn't be too risky to sign the house lease before everything was processed. I am supposed to go over tomorrow to sign the lease and today he told me that he only said he would because he didn't want me to screw up my finances by taking out a loan in my own name, but he doesn't want the responsibly of it hanging over his head for years. I would not be comfortable applying for a loan and signing the lease before I know if it gets approved if I did not have a co-signer. 

My relationship with my parents is getting increasingly strained and being at home is tense and anxiety-provoking for me. If it would be financially feasible to be a bit independent from them, I feel that would be good for me mentally and academically. However I understand that that is a huge privilege and that in life we often have to suck it up and muster through situations that aren't ideal because, well, we have to. So if it seems absolutely idiotic to try to move into this house at this time, let me know. 

Another part of this, though, is that after being yelled at by my father, I went over to my boyfriends as I didn't want to be in the house any longer and needed somewhere quiet to do my homework. I was visibly upset, so I told them what happened, and they right away offered to co-sign with me. In the past they have offered to be a ""backstop"" for me if I ever needed, even if my boyfriend and I broke up they say they want to help me. They assured me that the amount I would need to request ($13,700) isn't a scary amount to them and that they trust I will be responsible with the loan. 

I have less than 24 hours to make a decision but I feel that if I can be assured that this isn't a monumentally idiotic decision, I want to do it. I am nervous about being in debt to my boyfriend's parents or that being too much to ask of them. I'm worried that, with tensions already high between me and my own parents, that me getting support from his parents will make them feel hurt and further make things tense between us. I feel if I stay just to not hurt their feelings I will grow resentful and depressed, but if I leave while they are feeling abandoned and animus toward me, I won't feel right either. I want to have a good relationship with them but I also feel like I need so badly to get the hell out of there. 

So what do I do? Financially, how sound of a decision is it to co-sign a loan from SELF Loan or Wellsfargo for $13,700 with my boyfriends parents to cover housing and a remaining sum of my tuition? (only $7,150 will be used for the house, the rest I would have to take out anyways.

"Hey all, posted here several times before. Here's where we're at currently. I'm the manager of a certain fast food restaurant in the mall, been doing it for about a year now, plus another 8 years on the job. The owner is retiring in a few years and has talked to me about buying into the franchise as his successor.

I really love the idea of finally owning the place. And I've done the numbers over and over again, I would be making a lot of money if I managed to buy it. The thing is, I know there are no guarantees, even if I have his endorsement. Will corporate favour me? Will the bank lend me what I need? Maybe, maybe not. Also I'm getting contradictory information from the current owner and google about requirements to own my particular franchise.

Now, I'm really really good at customer service, like ungodly good at it. So naturally I attract a lot of attention, I've received a ton of job offers over the years. Mostly other entry level fields, so I just pass them over. Yesterday something rather exceptional happened, a man gave me his card, said he would like to talk to me about stealing me away from this job.

I'm going to phone him on Monday when they're open. I'd like to see what exactly is on the table, and I know at the very least I've landed an interview for some position.

However, the consequence being that I am shutting the door forever on the prospect of owning my current store.

It's basically down to if I want to take the safe path to financial security, or do I go the risky all in approach for even greater financial gain?

"Last month I was being contacted by a Debt Collector by mail for a debt which I do not recognise.

In accordance with information I found here - [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0219-disputing-credit-card-charges](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0219-disputing-credit-card-charges)

I sent them a letter by certified mail - saying I do not recognise the debt. I came to the US for the first time in 2014 and I had never had any associations with the original creditor.

I recently received a mail from their dispute department giving me details of the original creditor. As it turns out the account activity listed is from 2010-2013. Before I even entered the US.  They have even included the last 4-digits of an SSN which does not belong to me.

&#x200B;

In their first communication they have mentioned to me that they would not be suing me due to the age of the debt.

&#x200B;

How should I respond to them that the debt is not mine. Most likely they are mistaking me with someone else who had the same name as me.

The debt is not on my own credit report but it is a bit unnerving to find letters from collection agencies in the mailbox. Should I be taking any actions about this ?

"My husband and I found out that we are expecting our first baby in the spring. While this is a super exciting time, I've always had insecurities about our financial status. My parents have done very well, but growing up, my father was laid off from several jobs in the manufacturing industry. So I've learned to always be ""looking over my shoulder"" so to speak. In light of the baby, I've been feeling worried. We're 30 years old.

* No debt--my husband and I both purchased new cars in the last two years and paid them off shortly after purchase with cash. We have no student loans, no credit card debt.
* Roughly $80,000+ in retirement (not really examining my retirement as closely here as it's not something we'll access for the next, like, several decades. Thinking more liquid here).
* We are homeowners--our mortgage + taxes + insurance is actually less than $800 or so a month. We pay $200 a month extra to get ahead. We do very much consider this a starter home. We've been able to make a number of investments in the  home, all totally paid up in cash--new deck, new roof/repointed chimney (the roof was bad), new AC/furnace, lots of little stuff inside. Some of these renovations occurred this year, so we didn't save this year as much as I would have liked. 
* We live comfortably but aren't big on going out/partying it up. Our cable bill is probably our guilty pleasure...

"So over the years I have loaned some money to my friend with a pretty bad gambling problem.  

&#x200B;

In 2014 I loaned him $2600 over the first few months that he would normally pay me back right away.  It would be in smaller amounts of $600 here or $400 there.  He paid that all back.

&#x200B;

In October 2015 it hit the fan and I gave him $5,000.  He paid me back $5000 in April of 2016 when he got his bonus (sales job).

&#x200B;

In October of 2016 I loaned him $3,000 for some legal fees he had with a sever speeding ticket.  I once again got that money back in April of 2017, but this time he gave me $3,330 back as a thanks for my generosity.  

&#x200B;

In September of 2017 I gave him $1,000 that he gave me back in October.  One week later I gave him the $1,000 back and he gave me the money back in November. 

&#x200B;

In December of 2017 I gave him $5,000.  In February of 2018 I gave him an additional $900.  He paid me back a total of $6,400 for my generosity (this was in April of 2018). 

&#x200B;

In May of 2018 I floated him $1,500 that he paid me back in June.  

&#x200B;

That brings the total to $20,000 over the years.   I got back $20,800 total. 

&#x200B;

Now he asked again for money last month and I told him no.  He can't have anymore because he's got a problem and I was enabling him.  He understood and hasn't asked for anymore which is good.

&#x200B;

However, he's got some legal trouble.  In 2016 he wrote off his home office and personal car.  The problem?  He had a company car and the company reported it via some form.  So they audited his 2016 car allowances.  He wrote off $600 and was able to find $580 in gas station transactions.  Of course some of those where for things like cigarettes, but it doesn't show that on the bank statement.   He had the company car in Arkansas.  His personal car was in NC (family here) and he also told the IRS he used it because his territory was in NC (which wasn't true, but I am not sure how they can prove that?)   He got the IRS letter August of last month.  

&#x200B;

Now for 2017 he did two bad things.  First he originally didn't file his W2 from his second job.  Now he realized htey would catch on for him for this and filed an amended return.  However, that return stated that he owed $2,300, and and he mailed in the return WITHOUT the money.  The second thing he did was he wrote off his home allowance of saying he paid $2200 a month in rent.  However, he was paying his girlfriend half the rent due which was $500 a month.  His 2017 tax returns are not yet under audit. 

&#x200B;

For 2018 he current put down as many exemptions as they allow so he pays NO federal income tax each month.  He clears $9,000 a month in his bank account each month (none of it goes to savings).  However, for 2018 the home office deduction is gone for W2 employees.  

&#x200B;

So I see this going one of two ways.  1)  They say you can't write the car off and pay us the money.  2)  They say you can't write the car off and they smell a rat and keep going from there.  

&#x200B;

If it goes the second way will I be in any legal trouble?  To clarify some of the money I gave him was cash, and sometimes it was checks or Venmo.  Same with him paying me back.  He's also got some debt collectors after him too.

"So I was looking through the [US Unclaimed Wages/Property Website](https://www.usa.gov/unclaimed-money) and I realized I probably have several years of unclaimed money in the form of tax refunds. The thing about it is that I have not been diligent in filing every year, and I have no idea where to start. All of this begins around 2011 (when I was 18.) I have failed to file taxes in 2013, 2015, and 2017...

I'm not sure where to go about looking for my W2s for the various jobs I held in these years. I don't even remember how many or which jobs I had. I'm not sure whether I even *need* to file taxes for those years. I know that in the long run I'll probably be in trouble with the IRS if I owe them money, but by and large I've never held a job that paid over 20k/yr, and I'm almost completely certain I don't owe the IRS money since I claimed a reasonable dependency status on every W2 I've ever filled out.

So, two questions really:

*Am I unreasonably rolling the dice with the IRS if I choose not to file for these years, given the likelihood that they'll owe me money, and not the other way around?

*How do I go about tracking down my W2s for these jobs if I'm not even sure where I worked? Do I need to hire a tax attorney?

The payoff here for three years of refunds looks to be about 1200 dollars. If it would barely cover the cost of hiring an attorney (if necessary) it seems like a net negative to me, but I'm curious to hear everybody's thoughts.

I am not a smart man.

"Hello! I'll try to be brief. My Fiance and I are both working 70+ hour weeks (team leader in an automotive plant.) We're in school to get our associate's in nursing. We have about a year to a year and a half until our clinicals start and we can no longer hold a full time job, at least not a scheduled 9-5. 

&#x200B;

We possibly could stick it out until clinicals start with our current job, but even with easier classes right now, it's getting hard to keep up pace with working that much and school. We are thinking of getting jobs as servers, but I'm worried about being able to make it on that kind of income. I don't know how to estimate my income (we're in michigan if it matters,) so I don't know that we can afford to quit. 

&#x200B;

So our current monthly expenses look something like 2500. This breaks down to about 400 in food, 800 in rent, 800 for auto related (note plus insurance and fuel), 500 between utilities, misc spending, parking, laundry, etc. We could cut this down a lot by moving closer to work/school and save time to boot, so lets say 2300 (we're trying to find a place right now.)  We had a recent medical emergency, so we only really have 1000 as an emergency fund, and beside that we're pretty broke. WE both make around 750-1000 a week (I work a bit longer than her,) so we're hoping to get that emergency fund a bit more built up pretty quickly.

&#x200B;

We owe about 6700 on our car. If this got payed off our transportation would look more like 200/mo after moving closer to school.  

&#x200B;

So, what would the best idea, financially, be to go about quitting and start serving or something similar where we will surely be making a lot less? Should we just deal with the burnout and wait till clinicals start and get our EFUND as large as possible? What kind of income should we be budgeting for with a variable income job? What can we do about our insurance?

"So it's been around 2 years since getting my first car. I'll admit, it was a rushed decision and a stupid one at that. I was young and wasn't paying much attention to the numbers. Now I pay around $390 each month for this car, and thankfully my parents offered to pay for my insurance.

&#x200B;

I've been thinking about getting a new car and leasing it. This is due to the fact that ~~I'm not even sure if I'll still be living here in 3-4 years~~   I'm most likely moving out the country, to NY (where I wouldn't need a car), or to California (which is on the complete opposite coast). In addition, I would get much better mileage and only uses regular gas. Meanwhile my current car uses premium and gets only 19/29 mpg. I've been thinking of a couple options such as the civic hatchback and the c-hr. Both of which would be around a $200/month or so. And would require around a $3000 down payment.

&#x200B;

A couple options I am also thinking of are trading in my current car, which I still have payments left on. I'm not entirely clear on how that will work or if I'll get anything out of it. Otherwise I'll just pass this car off to my dad whose car is on the verge of breaking.

Another option is that my sister has left her car at home and was planning on selling it to the dealership as she now lives in the city and has no use for it. I could try to buy it off of her, but again it's mileage is bad as it's a 7 year old car and has has had problems in the past. But if I do buy it off of her, I could trade it in too then

&#x200B;

edit: the hatchback has a current offer of 2900 down and 189 per month for 36 months lease right now.

and the ch-r has a offer of 3k down and 169 per month for 36 months. These two offers are just estimates because of the whole credit thing.

I should also mention, I don't plan on driving it too much. Just as a commute for college and the occasional road trip to visit people if I decide to do that.

"I'm sorry, but I don't know what to flair this as, so I just chose other.

I attended a 4-year university for two and a half years, but I stupidly dropped out because I didn't know what I wanted in life and didn't feel that I was really to jump into (what I considered to be) proper adulthood so quickly. I wanted to take a year or two off before going to school, but, with my parents, that wasn't an option. I was pretty much forced to go to school.

I have just started paying my loans back. They are about $200/month. However, because I did so poorly, I lost my scholarships, grants, and federal loans for my last semester and the unpaid debt went to my state's attorney general because I couldn't set up an affordable payment plan with the school (they wanted $500/month). Because I live with my parents and only pay a few bills, I told the attorney general's office that I could pay $250/month.

I owe around $21k right now.

Recently, I have been feeling really bad about not finishing school. I have always wanted to be a teacher, even though I know they are severely overworked and underpaid. It's just something that I've dreamed of since I was little.

Is now a good time to go back to school? I know that school is expensive and I will be paying off loans for a long time. But, I am hoping to get a good portion of the cost covered by grants and scholarships.

Also, is there any way for me to lower my payments to the attorney general each month? Not by much, maybe $50-$75? I'm not sure that $450/month in just loans would be doable for me. Especially since I would be working a little less if I did go back to school.

"Ok, folks . As a preface, I’ll admit my issue here is a first world problem and is nothing compared to the real world struggles people post everyday worrying about how to make rent or put food on the table. I feel bad about even posting here but I think I can use some of your advice to help improve myself.

About 10 years ago, I started taking a close look look at personal finances after I was surprised how much my friend had saved since he graduated college. I would have argued that saving that much was impossible until he showed me how he did it. I got great motivation and became super good about building a budget and keeping it. In that time, my I ncome grew 10X (hard work, luck, and good negotiating) to well over 500k/year this year and savings are at $2M with no debt (no future liabilities like kids, education etc. either)

The problem is in the last year or so, I can’t just can’t stop spending on things I don’t really need. $5k watch? Sure. $10k camera/lens? No problem. $25k in vacations? Whatever. Because of the increase in income, I still sock away 400k+ a year in savings even after all the spending. 

However all my spending bothers me deep inside. I used to be very disciplined and lately I can’t do that anymore. I honestly want to get back to where I was saving really well and I worry in an economic downturn my income will go down significantly but I’d be stuck with lifestyle creep which I won’t be able to afford.

I could really use  advice from folks in my situation where income increased quickly on how they stay motivated to save well and to keep a leash on the lifestyle creep and get back to frugal ways?",14,1537078488.0,personalfinance,9g5h2z,3,Advice on staying disciplined?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9g5h2z/advice_on_staying_disciplined/

"My husband and I are trying to gain custody of a child currently in the US foster care system. Without going into all the nitty gritty details... we were told we'd have more success with a custody case rather than an adoption filing. So the adoption tax credit we were hoping to take advantage of is not an option. From basic googling I can't find any way to deduct legal expenses for custody cases on our taxes... but perhaps since the child is in foster care there may be something I'm missing?? Also when we were looking into adoption we were supposed to get a subsidized adoption since the child is technically considered special needs (10 years old diagnoses with ODD, ADHD, and PTSD), and this would help pay for her therapies and would allow her to remain on medicaid. I think with a custody case we no longer have these options available to us. This is in the state of VA.

Our attorney said it would likely be between 10-15 billable hours if this ends up in a court trial so we're looking at between $4k-$7k in legal fees.

New place is offering $18 to start, 2 weeks vacation(started with 1 at current employer), 6% 401k match, and annual VCP bonus. The company has been around for a while but has just opened a new location locally. Insurance is a lot higher then I currently pay and is non union, which I find weird because other locations are union. 

Weighing my options and the new place seems to have a better culture and be a better place but don't know if I want to lose my seniority and start over with a new company. I have a love/hate relationship with where I work now. I only have a week to make a decision and need some help Reddit!

"Hi, I am a first time poster but peruse here often. I am 30 y/o currently living with my bf (in the house he owns) but we are splitting up. We live in a high COL area in south Florida. My financial situation is not bad but I would like to get feedback from the savvy financial folks here on whether I should save more money to buy a house, focus more on saving for retirement/401k, or pay off student loans. I recently started paying aggressively towards student loans and have dropped the balance from $22k to $10k (avalanche method: I paid off the higher interest loans 6.8% and now have an avg APR of 3.74%.)

My current situation:

**Income and Savings**

Salary (depending on bonus @ end of year) $115,000-123,000

Take home monthly pay after taxes, health and 401k is $6,000

Current 401k \~$8,000

*(note: I put in 5% monthly employer matches 4%)*

IRA/Roth IRA/other investments \~$10,500

Savings (house fund) $42,000

**Rent & Bills**

My 1/2 of the rent is (this includes utilities) $1,000

Student Loans $10,905 (total) avg monthly payment for the past 6 months $1,200

Avg Misc spending a month for the past 6 months $2,000

(includes travel, food, restaurants, gas, home projects, etc)

**Options**

Average rent (studio/1 bedroom) $1,600

Average home price $400,000 Nerdwallet estimated $2,600 (mortgage, taxes, insurance)

**Notes**

In my opinion my retirement savings is very weak, but I've been focusing more on my house fund. I don't have a car payment (I drive a beater) but would need to start saving for future repairs or buying another car. I don't have debt other than my student loans. My credit is good/excellent.  I'd like to hear opinions on whether I should rent for 1 year and possibly save more (and get a nicer house $450k-500k) or try buying now.

"I hope this is the right place/way to post this. 

About 4 years, my credit was around 700. I was doing okay at a 30K job (low cost of living Texas) so I racked up quite a bit on CCs and store cards. Then I lost my job, moved back home and started making some poor life decisions. I was unemployed for 4 years. I have about 14K in debt (12K student loans). Most accounts have been closed and 3 are currently in collections. Student loans are “current” in forbearance. 

I (27) am trying to turn my life around. I got a job in June making about 22k and I’m not sure where to start. I got approved for the typical store cards (Fingerhut $300 and Conns Yes Money $2000) and Discover it Secured $200. I plan to use the Discover card for small purchases and make two payments per month and not letting a balance carry over. After two or three months, I’ll deposit more money to raise credit line. 

I have a bad feeling about using the store cards though as more than likely I wouldn’t be able to pay the full amount off within a month. I’m not sure if that would end up hurting my credit or the very least not help it go up. Right now I’m only trying to do what can/will raise my score that is currently under 600. Any suggestions on what I should do? I was told having two or three cards with small purchases that I pay off on a monthly basis is best thing to do. Is that right? Problem is I’ll probably only get approved for Secured cards. 

As far as budgeting and saving, next month I plan on starting to put $600-700 in savings per month. I’m setting my weekly budget at $140 (after bills) which I feel is very doable in my area. $20 per day is very fair and it helps me be more careful instead of just swiping my card. I plan on having two savings accounts; about $400 to #1 and $200 to #2 monthly. I’ll be transferring more money when I can. #1 being don’t touch unless emergency and #2 having a bit more wiggle room for play money. Reason being is I would like to take small trips with my GF now and then ($100-300 every few months). Other than for that, that account will also be no touch. Once the balance on #2 gets high enough, I’ll transfer half of it over to #1. 

Is it worth it opening an online high yield savings when my balance will be so low? It would have to be an account with an ATM card or instant transfer as I would need quick access to that money in the event of an emergency. 

What about investing apps like Acorns or Stash? Other cards I should apply for? Any other tips or suggestions?

"I’ve posted numerous times and have always received great advice, so I want to say thank you in advance. So 2 years ago I separated with my wife and moved back to my home town with my mother/sister/grandparents because I needed help with my kids. I was unemployed and incredibly depressed, I took a job making $13 an hour, and I received a couple of raises and promotions for working hard and what not. Last may after a bunch of great advice from this sub I’m now making close to $50k a year (with over time).  Because we live with family we don’t have many living expenses, and over the last 2 years I’ve paid off over 25k of debt, my credit score went from 590 to 720, and my only remaining debt are my federal student loans. My emergency fund is at about 3 months, and I have over 10k in credit cards if ever needed. To be honest I’ve been spending money kinda frivolously because I was going through a divorce and now because she passed away (retail therapy I guess). 

Because of her passing we’ll now receive about 1k a month in survivor benefits, and I don’t know how to plan for that. I could very quickly save up to buy a house right now, but I don’t know if that should be a priority because to be honest I still need help with my children, and there are so many other living expenses I’d absorb. Also we currently live in a suburb and I don’t know if I could afford to live in the area and keep my kids in the same school. Part of me feel like I should just leave that money separate and start college funds for all my kids. Also I’m 33 and don’t have much saved for retirement.

"Edit: here's a Sankey diagram I put together with my income/expenses. https://imgur.com/a/gxfZlIB

For some background: my husband and I have been married a little over a year. We combined finances completely when we moved in together, as I have a stable income and he was (still is) a student with only Pell Grant financial aid and a low-paying part-time job as income. Over time, due to rising costs of living (Orange County) and my compulsive spending habit (discussed below), we accrued something to the effect of $7k in auto loans (2.1%), $65k in federal student loans (4-7%), and about $35k in consumer debt (credit cards refinanced to fixed-rate and term unsecured personal loans - 7-14%).


I am the sole income earner. I just started a job in the past three months paying me $50k gross yearly, $35k after taxes, insurance/FSA, retirement, etc. deductions. My husband's grant financial aid and part-time student job bring us another $8-$10k/year net. We spend about $1000/month in debt/loan repayments, which amounts to the required payments on our fixed personal and auto loans, and the minimum amount allowed on the student loan REPAYE plan. 


Enter the problem: basically, due to a privileged upbringing, I never really learned the value of money. Throughout college my parents paid my bills, so I had no concept of how much life in Southern California actually costs. I had a shock when I graduated and my parents effectively cut me off. So, in the interest of maintaining my previous lifestyle, I became addicted to credit cards and spending money frivolously (stupid, I know). I racked up thousands of dollars in debt that I miraculously was able to keep up with the minimum payments on, but always rang them back up and kept opening new cards to keep up with my spending habits. 

Now, I'm sure that this is a story you've all heard before. What I am asking for is genuine, no-holds-barred, harsh truth about my situation and how the hell I am going to get out of it. I know I have a problem, but I don't even know where to start to fix it.

"Hi, Let me start this by saying that although my Dad has been successful in his career, he is absolute shit with money and legalities. He has lost more in shady get-rich-quick schemes than I can count, but has managed to aggregate a good amount of money despite that. His current financial advisor is retiring. I personally do not like this man. I am on one account with Dad, and the quarterly fees come from that one, so I know how much he's being paid, which seems like a lot.

He sent me several documents to sign and return indicating that he's retiring, and he wants to assign all of our accounts to another firm. The first question I asked him in reply was regarding the fiduciary relationship between us and him/new company. In the documents sent, the word ""fiduciary"" appears nowhere. Three days later, no response. I just read through all the ""investment objectives"" and they are all in the ""aggressive"" category- a philosophy I disagree with. 

Are there any other questions that I should ask before agreeing to this? I'd love to get my Dad to dump these advisors completely, as I see the commissions and fees, but he apparently loves getting ripped off. Smart man, idiot about money.

•My once very good credit is now shot, as I wasn’t able to make the payments on the car and it was repossessed. I got it back, but it’s up for repossession again.

what I know: I know you can open banks in places like Chase to put money in. you can have credit card and debit card (i know how they work and what they are used for). I also knew that chase gives saving and checking accounts. but learning more, it seems like there are other banks specifically made for savings accounts and they give high APR (interest rate?). I also learned that they are federally insured to 250k so I dont have to worry about losing my money.   


right now, my family has about 15k in chase saving account and i learned that they have .01% APR interest rate while others give 2% or more. should i be switching it? can you have more than 1 bank at the same time? IG: can you open a saving account in different bank and put our chase saving in there while continuing to use chase? what are the benefits and disadvantages of having saving account? can you take out money from saving account like regular or is it more like 401k? what is online banking? how should i worry about theft? what is liquidity? maintenance fee? and if these banks exist that give you these good interest, why would anyone ever save in any bank that gives less interest?

"I have an apartment that I have been renting, but due to some recent events, I'm considering selling. I'm trying to make a numbers based decision, so I'm going to compare two distinct scenarios: 

1) Keep property

2) Sell and invest in index funds that track the SP 500

To make this comparison, I'll have to consider the cost of ownership and make some assumptions are projected returns. Of course, before making any final decisions, I'm likely going to consult a financial professional. However, I'd like to wrap my arms around the options to see if either option is an obvious winner. **I don't know what I don't know. I'm certainly not a financial adviser by any means. I'd appreciate it if anyone can poke holes in my analysis here.**


**Option 1 (Keep property)**

Monthly expenses (mortgage + interest + insurance + upkeep + other fees): E

Rental income: I

Inflation rate: i

Years remaining on mtg: N

Present value option 1: PV1

Future Value option 1: FV1

appreciation rate: a



FV1 = appreciation of the property + income - expenses

FV1 = FVa + FVi + FVe



FVa = PV(1 + (a-i))\^N

FVi = I(1+i)\^N

FVe = E(1+i)\^N

FV1 = PV1(1 + (a-i))\^N + (I - E)(1+i)\^N



**Option 2 (Sell property and invest in market)**

Projected sale price: S

Current balance: B

Commissions rate: c

Years remaining on mtg: N

capital gains tax rate: g

capital gain deductions: D

capital gain: G

capital gain tax: T

avg market return: m

avg dividend return: d

avg inflation: i

present value option 2: PV2

future value option 2: FV2



If S greater than B: Capital Gains

If S Less than B, ignore capital gains tax

G = (S - B)\*(1 - c)

T = (G - D)\*g

PV = G - T

FV2 = PV2(1+(m+d-i))\^N

**Results**

If FV2 greater than FV1, sell and invest in market

Else, hold property

         -1 has an $850 limit, with a current $280 balance that I plan on paying off next week (due date is the 1st of the month) 
         - I make sure to pay off my monthly balance (which is rarely over $150/month... current balance due to car rental last week as I was on vacation visiting family)

*other debt:

          -student loans: ~$17,000 (I’m still in school so no payments necessary at this time) 

*monthly take home pay: ~$2,100/month (I make $31/hr, 24 hours/week, biweekly pay.. I lowballed the $2,100 to account for taxes and my FSA account that takes out $100/month and my union dues). 

Bills:

*car payment: $228/month 

*car insurance: $68/month 

*cell phone: $100/month 

*groceries: $200+/month (yes I NEED to work on this and am actively reducing grocery costs!! But still any advice on how to eat healthy, vegetarian and CHEAP is welcome! This amount is WAY too high!)

*I currently have about $1,800 in my savings, which I just started putting $425 per paycheck (biweekly) into.

Also, I am pretty financially illiterate. Parents don’t help out much as far as advice, so if anyone has any suggestions, advice, or anything that they wish they knew or think might be helpful, please share!

"The general consensus is that co-owning property with someone who you’re not married to is bad. I asked a similar question earlier this year but situations have changed and I have new information so let me describe what’s up:

My boyfriend owns a condo that is worth twice it’s mortgage. He took a pay cut a while before I met him, accrued debt, and ended up having to take a Point “loan” to pay it off. The Point company actually buys a share of the property’s equity and the dollar amount goes crazy up if the property goes up in value. As such I’d like to get rid of it ASAP while it’s still feasible. 

The condo is in San Francisco. The chance of it going down in value is low and the chance of it becoming underwater is almost nil.

The Point loan drastically improved my bf’s credit score since it is not debt. He almost makes enough money to refinance on his own but not quite.

My boyfriend wasn’t working when I last asked. It was a weird situation but it all worked out in his favor and he’s working again. He was paid for all the time he wasn’t working as well. I hate his job and would like to encourage him to go back to school full time next year (he’s doing it part time already).

I’m planning on marrying him next year as well. We’ve discussed marriage and the only reason we aren’t engaged is that I set an arbitrary stipulation that we can’t until we’ve been dating for 2 years. I read that couples who date for 2 or more years before marriage last longer. 2 years is in early November.

I could afford the entirety of our mortgage on my salary with or without the refinance.

So my bf tried to qualify for a refinance to get rid of the Point loan and do some house updating type stuff. He doesn’t make enough still to do so. However, combined I have no doubt that we would qualify. 

I’m told that I can be put as tenancy with right of survivorship without problem to become an equal owner. My bf is comfortable with this idea. I’m on the fence, to be honest, mostly because of the advice on this sub and other internet sources.

I can’t really see the risk in this situation, though. It seems like this would only be working out in my favor. I’d suddenly own half of an asset that is extremely valuable which I also can afford on my own in its entirety. The risk seems to be placed almost fully on my boyfriend’s shoulders, and he’s comfortable with that. 

TLDR:

I’d like my bf to refinance his condo. I can become a tenant with right of survivorship to make that happen. We aren’t yet married or technically engaged (though we wear rings as if we were). I’m not worried about breaking up, but even if we did, suddenly I’d own half of a very valuable asset.

"A friend in California has recently become conservator of her elderly mother. As part of the conservatorship, the courts have ordered that the bulk of the mother's money be placed in blocked conservatorship accounts.  Furthermore, they have asked that since the amount of money is large, the money be placed in multiple institutions, each with an amount under the FDIC limit.

However, this friend quickly learned that some banks basically lose their shit when you ask them to open a conservatorship account.  They just aren't good at it.  At Wells Fargo, it took them five and a half hours to get the account open, as they had to escalate to upper management and their legal department multiple times.  Word on the street is that Bank of America is apparently not much better.

"Hello sub, I have a concern I would like to relate to you all. Please keep in mind, I am twenty-four years old and this is the only property I have ever owned. Around 5 years ago me and my sister were given a property totalling I was told around 0.88 acres. It’s a simple, set of four lots bordering a somewhat low-income area. It was until recently quite out of sorts with large concrete chunks and such littering it all over. Some people had also thrown sofas and some couches on the property. It was not in good shape. Since, I haven’t had much drive to do anything with the property, it has just kind of sat. I know I should have done better, but, I have has many concerns over the years and this just isn’t one of them.

Recently, however, a note was received in the mail from the fity demanding that it be cleaned up and accompanying it were some dire threats of this was not carried out. My sister’s husband attempted to clear and smooth it out but it was apparent that his equipment, a tractor, was not sufficient. He was thanked profusely for his efforts, nonetheless. Me, my mom, and my sister sat down and discussed options. My mom called the city and they were very gracious and understanding and gave us a two-week extension. We decided to get quotes on dirtwork options and my sister mentioned that her husband had a family friend who did stuff like this, and, that it would cost $2000. Me and my mom explained that it would be better to do some more looking since we had time and it was understood that more quotes would be gathered. 

A few days of me and my mom looking for quotes, my mom discovered an experienced owner and operator of a bulldozer who would do the job for $800. A day later, a bulldozer was seen on the property as the $800 operator was shown the property. My mom immediately discovered that my sister had given the go-ahead for the family friend to do the work. We were both furious. My sister was immediately called and questioned and she revealed she bad done this. (A quick aside: my sister is overweight, impulsive, and not really bright at all. She had to take low level math classes to pass high school. Impetuously thinks she grasps topics that are far beyond her understanding.) On the phone call she immediately starts bawling and whining pitifully, her typical response to any serious mistake.

Next day, her husband comes riding into my mom’s house complaining about the phone call (nothing unreasonable was said) and then my sister arrives. A long conversation ensues in which sister and her husband pressure me over and over again to sell this property and I kept reiterating that it needs to be fenced and surveyed and that I need to speak with some sort of financial advisor to see if this is a good decision. (The taxes on the property are very, very, very low and I have been curious about whether it will appreciate). It also slips out in the conversation that sister’s husband’s cousin, that they share a business with, is wanting a new place to house their equipment for their propane business. This was a discussion in which I was calm and considerate of their viewpoints but my sister was curling up on the couch and screeching like a drowner poked with a silver sword.

I am currently going to school right now after leaving an awful, yet lucrative job. I have few financial obligations except for school, which, I might leave if the right job pops up. I am just asking what you guys think I should do. Buy her out, sell her my share? Should I buy it to let it appreciate and sell it later? I really don’t relish living in that area again.

"Hello r/personalfinance

&#x200B;

I'm 36 years old and the sole income provider for my family of 4 at about $107k a year. (\~$98K with a $9800 bonus at the EOY)

&#x200B;

My utilization on my credit cards is pretty high, around 58% and it's significantly impacting my credit score. It's currently at 644 which is a 45 point drop over the last 3 months. That's mostly from two cards that are very close to being maxed out. One with a $7500 limit and one with $8500.

&#x200B;

On average my budget allows me to pay 1.5x to 2x the minimum per month on both but I can't seem to make much headway against the balance and occasionally something unexpected comes up like a medical expense which over extends me and forces me to fall back on one of those cards for gas or groceries between paychecks essentially eliminating my progress for that month.

&#x200B;

I recently discovered that I can borrow against my 401k up to about $19k and the terms seemed pretty reasonable; 6% APR with that interest being paid back toward myself. That's much lower than the two credit cards that are contributing the most to my credit debt. I have no plans to leave my current employer and there is very little risk of my job being in jeopardy anytime in the future.

&#x200B;

I would like to buy a house at some point in the next few years and would very much like to improve my credit score in the short term.

&#x200B;

So my questions are: Would borrowing against my 401k to pay down those two credit cards be a bad idea? Would that even improve my credit score since I'm just shifting the debt to another source? Do the APR terms really mean this loan wouldn't cost me overall? And would consolidating those two cards into a single loan bring down my monthly payment and provide me more buffer for those unexpected expenses?

&#x200B;

This option looks very attractive to me at the moment, but I'm concerned I'm missing a big ""gotcha"" somewhere.

&#x200B;

Thanks r/personalfinace!

&#x200B;

\*\*Edit\*\*

Changed ""limit"" to ""minimum"" in one sentence because that's what I meant.

&#x200B;

I wanted to add a little detail too. A few responses are suggesting I need to focus on my spending problem first. While I completely agree that my spending is what led to this issue in the first place (partially, we also had an emergency move awhile back that depleted a lot of our savings and put a lot on our credit) I'm not really spending on luxuries. My budget is as tight as it is because I'm attempting to pay aggressively toward my credit debt. I'm pay $1000 to $1200 toward balances and savings per month.

&#x200B;

I have two trouble credit cards that are near their limits. That represents about 58% of my total available credit on other cards. I have several cards on which we maintain a zero balance and never touch, only keeping for extreme emergencies. One of the goals in paying down or paying off these trouble cards is to treat them the same, to put them away and not use them, not to open up more credit to spend on. I'm currently using my cards very infrequently. Sometimes not at all each month.

"I understand the love for Target Date Funds and my TSP is fully in one of the lifecycle funds.  But for my Roth IRA, and in general, I'm questioning some things. I'm probably just an idiot so help me out and thanks in advance.

Let's say you are an early 30s individual starting to invest in a TDF on a Roth IRA. You have TSP, federal pension, and social security down the line, so the Roth IRA is on the side.  As guinea pig funds let's take the Schwab SWYJX Target Index 2055 and Schwab SWTSX Total Stock Index.  You didn't start investing when you were 20, so you already feel a bit behind. For the Roth, long term gains are the goal, not lowering short term risk.  

Why on Earth would you want to be in bonds and international to such a large extent in SWYJX? Couldn't you very easily get superior returns from staying in the admittedly more volatile SWTSX for 10-15 years, selling during a good period, and switching to the TDF for the last 20 or so years? 

I understand the concepts of diversification and the ease of the TDF, and also that past superior returns on SWTSX or similar funds are no guarantee of future returns. But the more I read, the more the consensus seems to be that long term stock index holders do best.  So my question can be distilled down to: why not hold a riskier but higher growth index fund to enjoy better returns for a mid to long period and then shift to the TDF later on during a good time, and enjoy the diversification and portfolio adjustment it provides during your sunset years?  What am I missing? Why not just be fashionably late to the TDF party, wouldn't you still reap the benefits?

"I had my first child in December. She was born with a heart defect and a hereditary disease. All of our savings went into that. (Good news! The disease ended up being extremely mild and she will very likely never show and symptoms, and the heart defect resolved itself as of June. So she is healthy now. )

In May I was laid off from my job, with no chance to replace any savings. I have been surviving on unemployment Benefits. $466 a week. I applied for and was approved for Utah Medicare. 

I got hired at Goldman Sachs and am currently waiting to clear background so I have been given as official start date and I have not signed any offers. 

Earlier this week I got sick and my doctor found signs of leukemia. That night I was admitted and it was confirmed. I have acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 

The hospitals in Utah are very good about treating you with out ever even looking at your insurance. So I’m not too concerned about paying for the chemo. But I am very worried about paying monthly bills and food for my family. 

I had applied for the state run food stamps and financial aid which would be roughly $300 for food a month and I’m not sure how much the financial aid is. I wouldn’t guess more than 300-400 a month. My unemployment is gone since I was admitted to the hospital. One of the requirements is that you have to be able to work 40 hours a week. 

I live in Utah, USA, I am married but my wife is a resident not a citizen, and I have a 9month old daughter. I am 35 years old.  

I own my home, mortgage is $960 a month, I own my car but we paid it off. I have $5000 in credit card debt.

"Yesterday while driving down the aisle of my apartment, a neighbor was backing up. I had just started driving from a couple of parking spots behind her and when I was on the aisle, I was just glancing at the rear view mirror. Now she backed up onto me while I was looking at the rear view mirror and there was a deep scratch from the front of my passenger side all the way. This happened in an instant and we both have insurances with the same provider. When I called up my insurance (after driving), the insurance person said that the other driver has said we were both backing up (?!?!). Now I do not want to fight with her(i.e. the other driver) on this. I have the photos and I have uploaded and I believe the insurance provider will resolve this.

In the meanwhile I want to get this scratch repaired. It is a deep scratch. I checked with a car body shop and they said estimate is $4K to $5K. Is it really worth so much for such scratch. Now the insurance company says they can pay me only $900. What are my options ?

"Hi, long time lurker here:

I would like to make a spreadsheet where I can keep track of the state of my savings account and I am looking for things to include, such as certain metrics or useful graphs.

Background:  
I am 27 years old and I have landed my first ""big boy"" job out of college which pays enough that I can save roughly 25% of my gross income and still live a balanced life. While studying I had zero savings but also no debt, the apartment I live in is bought and paid for and I have a lodger so the rent roughly pays for the utilities. The only credit I have is a 0% one on my phone, which if I REALLY needed to cut expenses I could afford to buy out, I just figured if it would cost the same paid it over two years I might as well do that.  
I don't have a specific goal I'm saving up for, I would like to start investing it eventually but I need a lot more for that so right now my ""goal"" is to just have a larger lump. Until I start investing, this money would also be my emergency fund.

What I would definitely need in the spreadsheet is to both have a ""**cash-flow**"" part to see how much is in the savings account and an ""**income statement**"" part that let's me see how much money I am owed and when it is due (I have for example lent some money to a friend - who I trust completely). I also want to be able to see **how I spend** it when I take money out (I had some unexpected expenses in July as well as a planned holiday which I ended up paying for by not saving anything that month... this is fine as a once-off thing but it would be bad if I abused this loophole). Also obviously this spreadsheet would be the basis for the one I have when I start investing.

Any ideas for what to add would be appreciated.",2,1537050962.0,personalfinance,9g1xd0,1,Keeping track of my savings,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9g1xd0/keeping_track_of_my_savings/

"My partner and I both have 2010 vehicles. His is beginning to show signs of wear that suggest major repairs may be needed in the next 12-18 months. Mine is so far ok, but it has driven poorly in the climate we live in since we moved here. I would especially like to have AWD for the winter. 

Long story short, we feel like we need to trade his car in in the next 1-3 months, and I’m flirting with the idea of trading mine as well. However, I don’t have to right now, and I’m only at about 20% on doing it. I’ve read enough Dave Ramsey to not like the idea of an unnecessary car payment, and we’re currently working on snowballing our debt away anyway. 

The financial details:

* My car is paid off with a KBB value of $2500-$3500
* His car is *not* paid off, and is under water by about $1000
* I am the only one on my car’s title but we are both on his title and loan
* We could afford to increase his car payment and add a payment for me. 


My questions: 
1. Is it at all financially smart to trade two cars at once?
2. Our combined income is high, but we also have hefty student loans (both lawyers) and want to buy a house in the next 12-18 months. Will two at once kill our credit?
3. If we could do this, would it be smarter (rate wise)  to sign on to both titles and loans together or separately?

"Hello there.
Short facts for the beginning: (maybe a tl;Dr)

- 16
- Poland
- Legally allowed to work half-time for nearly a month now
- Hosted a server at my parents' house
- Bills increased by around 20-30% due to people downloading shit off that server
- My parents give me two options: 
· Either pay the bill
· or leave
- My current financial standing would allow me to pay around 30-35% of the bill.
- Parents forced me to pack my shit and now here I am, with the possibility to be kicked out at any given moment

More in depth at the moment:
Scared as hell. I would have *nowhere* to go if I get kicked out. I've got two friends and a girlfriend, one friend lives in a flat but no space in there for me to even squeeze in, girlfriend is on a scholarship 400km away. (And the second friend lives in Germany now)

I have always lived with my parents who I never had that good of a situation with, relationship-wise. I have no other family nearby (or at least I do not know of any, that might be a possibility too). I might have something to do as long as I have my mobile data plan, but then I'm screwed up.

"So I'm considering two master's programs for my MBA. One is Florida State University, and the other is University of West Florida. One costs 16k, the other 30k not including fees and all that mumbo jumbo.

**NOW BEFORE YOU GO FLYING OFF THE HANDLE** **saying, ""THIS ISN'T A FINANCIAL QUESTION!"" Let me clarify:**

*I want to look at this not from a collegiate approach, but purely a financial cost-benefit analytical approach with facts and reasoning.*

[Linked here is the first argument I found on Google](https://www.forbes.com/sites/financialfinesse/2016/11/10/is-an-expensive-college-worth-it/#73b3cb98a3f8): "" In many areas of life, we get what we pay for. That doesn’t mean the more expensive college choice is always the better one though."" I can attest to this. I currently work for a corporation that will pay 4k per year for a Master's degree program. But think about it... If I spend TWICE as much, do I get twice as much assistance from them? NO! Will my salary increase EVEN MORE because I went to one school as opposed to another? Not from what I could find...

My theory, and again, this is just theory, not factual, is that some of these universities have 'passthrough costs' to their end users. So take USC, University of Southern California, for example. California is really damn expensive. You're not just buying that product at that high price because of prestige or supply/demand. You're paying passthrough costs of them existing in a really, really expensive place. Whereas if you went to a school out in BFE that has little overhead, the passthrough costs are negligible. 

&#x200B;

The only reason I got the loan at all is because my parents, who make near $100k combined, agreed to cosign, but their credit was also not great.

My credit score has also vastly improved. It's up to 655 according to Credit Karma, which while not great is a lot better than the 500 I started out at. Both Creditwise and Credit Karma are suggesting I refinance to lower my interest rate, resetting my loan by a few months (original was for 72 months and suggested refinance is 60 months, I'm currently at 52 months). My current monthly payment is $285.64. My parents, who have also improved their credit in the intervening years, have agreed to cosign as long as it results in a lower monthly payment.

I am preparing to begin applying for, and hopefully attending, graduate school to enter my ideal career. While I can afford the payments now, reducing them would be helpful when the time to find an apartment comes. I plan to keep working in grad school as long as I am able to, but even a little budgetary wiggle room would be immensely helpful. At the moment, I have no other expenses besides a student loan that will enter repayment in December, and my current job(s) are enough to handle my debts and save to build an emergency fund. I am fortunate to still be living with my parents until grad school, and possibly through it if I attend one of the schools on my list. I'm planning on putting my student loans in in-school deferment for grad school and fighting hard to make payments on the interest for the unsubsidized loans.

My question is: does it make financial sense to pursue refinancing now, or wait until I'm closer to moving for grad school? If I refinance, would more money go to the principal, or should I stay at the higher rate if it's reducing the principal faster? My current lender, Ally, does not allow payments directly to principal. If I refinance now, I imagine it would also make sense to take the now freed money and add it to my slowly growing emergency fund until such a time as that money is needed for other necessary expenses.",3,1537041085.0,personalfinance,9g0w4e,1,"Should I refinance my loan now, or wait?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9g0w4e/should_i_refinance_my_loan_now_or_wait/
"Hello. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this. 

So, moved into new apartment and want to buy a new TV. First big electronics purchase besides phones (current tv I got for free for graduation present) and kinda lost. Saved up some for a cheaper model, but have since been convinced to not buy cheap brands and low quality for many reasons, so planning on buying a more expensive model even if that means making a couple payments. 

Both Costco and Bestbuy have the same tv for the same price. With Costco, I'd have to pay for it all upfront on my card and pay credit card interest (23% on my current card, ??? If I get their card). This would be there first time in two years I've carried a balance on a credit card. Dont like that idea. But they do throw in a free 3 year extended warranty (5 years if I sign up and use their costco credit card). With that, I'd have the whole thing paid off in two months, meaning one month of interest. (note; have costco membership for free through my parents' ranch).

Bestbuy has their no interest financing for 24 months. But I'd have to pay for their extended warranty. Meaning I'd be looking at three months to pay it off, though I'd have to ability to stretch it out more if need be.

Basically, has anyone used either, or both of, these companies? How are they? How are their warranties? Is costco's warranty good enough for one month of interest on less than a $1000 (since I plan on using what I saved and only charging the remaining balance), or are the the same enough that 0 interest from bestbuy is the better option?",39,1537041032.0,personalfinance,9g0vxz,0,Buying TV - Costco vs Bestbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9g0vxz/buying_tv_costco_vs_bestbuy/

"Hello,

whenever I see calculators for retirement plans, they always assume that you derive an income from investing your money and never touch the principal.

This got me thinking - what if don't want to leave a penny to my name?
That is, you just assume you'll live to be 100, and the principal can be down to 0 at that point (i.e., during your retirement you can use any combination of investment income from the principal and drawdown from the principal itself ).

Would this mean I'll need a smaller pension pot when I stop working?

Does anyone know of a model / calculator that shows how this would work, considering taxes and inflation?

"Hello,

I'm a university student from Sweden. For full time studying here we receive a monthly grant of approximately 350 USD. On top of that we have the option of taking out a state backed student loan for an extremely low interest rate (it's almost always been <1%, as per 2018 it is 0.13%) of about 800 USD a month. I have no experience investing whatsoever but since I can cover my expenses comfortably with my monthly grant and a part time job, I almost feel like I'm burning money by not applying for this loan and automatically investing all of it every month in some sort of index fund or something.

 This is a very long story that leads up to me buying a car from a used car dealer 1 year ago 09/21/17. Ripped off in the process on price and trade in. Car blows engine 1 month later. I don't have money to fix car, buy I had another daily. I had a 5.5k loan out on the car with a 13%apr. Loan has 1k left on it and will be paid off soon. Now I have other credit card debit, but I should close most of those out within a few months. The question is when I finish most of the credit card debit and the loan. Should I rebuild/fix the car? Its a 2005 wrx with a blown engine. Im looking at USDM engine swap with clutch and a few upgrades at $3500. Car will then be worth around 7-8k. Rn car is parked in my mechanics lot. He thinks I will 100% fix it so he has not said anything for basically the past year. If I choose not to fix it he will most likely want parking fees for the car which may total 1k and then I can maybe sell the car for 2k or just give it to him and take a total loss. 

I am just scared the car will break again,but I really want something fun and I was going to buy a miata or 350 but this is way better. I will hopefully have around 2500 saved to fix the car in December, the rest will just be parts and stuff that I will put on credit. The goal is to drive it for a year or so and sell it along with my daily and then we can see where the world takes us. Either a truck to support my motorcycle track hobby. Or just sell my daily and get an SUV as a daily and keep the subie for a 500hp rebuild when the engine blows again.

"TL;DR: Need a car. Want to go back to school and get a degree to advance my income level without piling on debt. Had to use a lot of savings recently. Have a steady job now and the ability to start saving. How do I start? And in what order, car or school or compromise on both? Also advice on getting more (better than almost no) credit and what to look for in what to do and not to do if I finance a car. 


I am trying to save money up to go back to school and now a car as well. A little background: 

This past year my car broke down while around this time I was also moving jobs. My previous job as a restaurant manager was a steady and had fine, if not great, income but the mall where my restaurant was located was under new ownership and they were planning on closing it and building condos. I knew we would be closing sometime in the near future but not the exact date so I decided to be proactive and find new employment. This left me with a tentative job that moved my start date up and no work for over a month after I gave my notice and left my previous job. 

The upcoming work was event bartending  but I found out that I was basically an independent contractor since the work wasn’t as steady as I had expected. I had some savings since I was expecting and preparing to buy a new car since mine was on it’s last legs. With the unexpected gap in employment and after lack of stable income I had to dip (or more accurately free dive) into my savings at which point my car decided to breathe it’s last breath. 

Which takes me to now in which I have a second, (relatively) steady income as a bartender at a mid-high end range establishment. I am just starting to get back on my feet in terms of savings but I desperately need a car and I have been trying to get back to school for about 7 years at this point. I don’t want to be in the restaurant industry forever and I especially don’t want to be a bartender for the rest of my life. To get ahead in basically any other non-hospitality/service industry (and even some of those) you need at least a bachelor degree but I also don’t want to take on a huge amount of debt in the process that would negate any pay bump that may be possible. 

My plan for school was to go to a community college for my associates then transfer to a state school and hopefully be able to find some scholarships or grants along with financial aid so I wouldn’t end up even more destitute than I am currently. I also don’t want my grades to suffer due to the fact that I will probably have to work almost full time if nothing changes. 
 
My plan for the car was to save some money for a down payment. Try to build up my, essentially non-existent, credit while I’m saving. Then finance a nicer, more reliable car so I won’t have to worry about my shiny, new, paid-in-cash shitbox breaking down every time it rains. 

It is late and I know this is long and my ADHD meds have long worn off so who knows how coherent but I SINCERELY thank anyone in advance who can provide some insight or advice because I am so lost as to what to do or how to even start right now. 


Edit to add: I also had recently been offered another restaurant manager position by a previous co-worker/manager. I am debating whether it would be lucrative enough to be worth switching employers again. The hours would probably be less flexible if I wanted to finish school but the pay would be more steady. I need to get the car first either way but I don’t know if another uprooting and new start would be worth it.

"So husband and I are looking to buy our first home. We’ve narrowed it down to two homes. One is within our budget (House A), one is on the tip top of our budget (House B). We’re looking to put about 5% down on both houses. Both houses are located in an area that is exploding and will gain equity. There are large companies moving to the area bringing hundreds of thousands of people to this city. 

We make about $60K in income currently. Next year we will be making $90k as I will go back to work (staying home with our first child). We currently have $2,300 of recurring monthly expenses (health insurance, electricity, etc... I’ve rounded up on all expenses when working numbers bc houses are always more expensive).

House A is listed at $260k and is on 1 acre, comes with fancy appliances, pool, and lawn mower. 3 bed/2 bath. It’s only 1,700 sq feet, but needs no upgrades. Downside is the bedrooms are small. It would be a good home for about 5/6 years, but we will out grow it. It’s in a good, established neighborhood. Estimated mortgage costs (including taxes, insurance, etc.) would run about $1,900 rounding up. Based on my numbers we’d be spending roughly 38% of our income on the house and be able to save about 14% of our annual income.

It’s the cheapest house in the neighborhood, but will probably be worth double in the long run. It’s 4 bed/2 bath. 2,300 sq feet, needs no upgrades. Gorgeous house and we could easily stay in it for 10+ years. Downside is the price and no land. Estimated mortgage cost (if we offer $270k because sellers are motivated. It’s been on the market for 4+ months and relator said they’re hoping to get $280k) is about $2,200 (including taxes, pmi, etc.). Here we’d be spending roughly 45% of our income on the house and only save 7-9% of our annual income. 

I know the obvious answer is to go with House A; it’s cheaper. However, we’d grow out it quickly, and the opportunity for equity gain is not there nearly as much as House B (it’s still there, but House B is in THE neighborhood- seriously. Houses are selling from between $300k-$700k in that neighborhood). It’d be a struggle for the next year, but I think it would be worth it in the long run because of the equity gain and we’d be able to stay in the house for 10+ years. Or am I just being dumb thinking that it may be financially safe and plausible? Thoughts?

"Hello,

The title says it all.  I am currently drowning in CC debit and I need to fix it.  Paying just the min on each isn't doing anything and I can't seem to get the ""snowball effect"" to start rolling.  I have done a personal loan in the past which really helped me get back on track but after we bought our house a couple of years ago the CC debt has been creeping up and it's no longer viable to keep paying so much in fees.   


Please see the attached pic for a breakdown of our CC debit, other monthly bills and payments and income.  Wife doesn't currently work as she's staying home with our daughter and finishing school at the same time.  It'll be a while before she'll be able to get back into the workforce and start helping me with all this.  


At the same time we are in an older house so another big ambition is to move to a new one that's closer to work/friends.  Currently we are pretty far away from it all so location isn't ideal and my work commute is not great.  It was a great starter home at the time to get into but I feel like if we can knock this CC debit down quite a bit, we can comfortably start looking for a better home.

&#x200B;

One last thing on the personal loan.  My Credit Score isn't great because of the high CC debt - 675.  This is why a personal loan for me will get me a high APR which isn't something I want.  On the other hand my wife's Credit Score is 720 but since she isn't working her income is 0 and I don't know how to use her credit score with my income to get a better deal on a loan.  My current loan that I'm almost done with was a 36 month, 20K at 5.99% for 677/mo.  I'm thinking if I get a 30K loan to get 85% of my CC debit on it, it'll be just under 1000/month for 36 months which is doable since I'm paying $940 as it is on CCs now of which more than half goes to fees.

"I figured I'd share my story for anyone interested. Drove my 2002 Toyota Camry into the ground, at ~270k miles it needed an immediate $1k in repairs (timing belt, primarily) with another $2k in repairs likely coming sometime in the next year according to my long time mechanic. 

So I bit the bullet and decided I would buy a new used car. I spent $4k cash on my last car so I figured I'd upgrade and spend $5-7k on my new car. Because of some complications with the birth of our new kid, my wife and I recently depleted cash on hand to the point where I didn't want to pay for a car in cash. When I approached a few different financing options, they all wanted to charge me 7%+ APR on the ~$5k I wanted to borrow, which was not something I wanted to deal with. 

I'd read online that most dealerships would accept a credit card for some amount of payment, but the details were hazy. Most blogs / forums seemed to have the number pegged around $5k on a card, so I opened a new card with some initial spend bonus points AND a 15 month 0% intro APR (it always shocks me how easy it is to open a card, I have decent credit at about 720 ish, and every time I open a card it's usually around a $10k limit).

The car shopping process was lame, I drove at 6 dealerships, about a dozen total cars over the course of a week. Finally found a super clean, full maintenance records, 2005 Toyota Matrix, 135k miles, $5.2k KBB FPP, listed at $5.9k. Because I was a ""cash"" buyer I asked to talk out the door price, which started at $6.5k. I immediately refused that and the salesman came back with $6k out the door. I told him he had a deal if I could write a check for $1k and put $5k on my new card. 

This is where the theatrics started. He went to his manager and came back and said he could only do 2.5 on the card. I said it was that or I'd walk, so he goes and gets his manager who explains that it's ""corporate policy"", to which I replied that it was the only way I was interested in completing the purchase. He said he'd go talk to someone who had been at the company longer, and miraculously managed to get approval after about 30 seconds on the phone with this mysterious old timer.

"Hello all,
Back in 2012 I was working at a local pizza restaurant doing cooking and prep work. I had just started college. While prepping tomatoes one day with a mandolin slicer, it slipped off the edge of the countertop and fell. I reflexively tried to catch it. Catching a row of knife blades with your hand is not a good idea. 

I got some basic medical treatment while at work, but after looking at the injury some more my manager and I determined I would probably need some stitches for my fingers. She told me to just go to the local urgent care and to not worry about the workers comp side of things as the business owner said he would just pay the bill whenever I got it. AFAIK, there was never any workers comp paperwork completed. The cuts just needed some medical grade superglue-no disability or serious injury, just some pretty decent scars.

After receiving the bill I brought it in to work for the owner. I continued to receive bills from the urgent care, so I brought in and gave another copy of the bill to be passed on to the owner. I ultimately left the job and changed residences. 

Fast forward a couple years and I started getting  calls from a collection agency. I explained the situation to them, but they had been sold the debt by the urgent care (which had shut down due to the Dr.'s medical license being suspended) and asked to see the workers comp paperwork. I attempted to contact the pizza place's owner, but couldn't ever get hold of him. The medical bill was reported as a collections account. It is the only negative mark on my credit report and I haven't gotten any further calls from them.

What are my options for getting the collections account removed? I am not sure whether to go to the Montana State Fund, which administers workers comp, for assistance, or to pursue legal action against... somebody. Yes, I am an idiot for letting it get this far. Also, the collections agency did a hard pull of my credit in 2016- is that allowed, or worth disputing? 

The original medical bill balance was around $400. With the collection agency fees, it's gone up to a little over $600. I can easily pay the bill, so I have also considered figuring out a pay to remove arrangement.

Thanks for any and all help.

I received no treatment, I literally sat there until I was let go. They got all my information and charged me for the stay, over $1,000 to my credit. It was as if another credit card had been opened in my name so I could make payments on the medical bills, and this was back in May of this year.

"Living in the state of a Indiana. GF and I are trying to buy a house. We are have everything to the mortgage company EXCEPT my 2016 W2 from a previous employer. I realize I screwed up by not keeping it, but my mom helps me with taxes and such and she has copies of everything BUT that one plus I was only 21 at the time so kinda stupid in general.

&#x200B;

**The Goals:** Buy a house, pay it off, live somewhat frugally, start own business, retire or soft-retire (timeline still pending).

&#x200B;

**The Beginning:** My husband and I are both 32.  We have no children, and intend to have no children.  We live in Houston, Tx.  He is a licensed plumber about 4 1/2 years away from his Master license.  I am a new apprentice plumber, and have 20 months to go until my Tradesman license.  We have very recently had the light bulb moment where we realized we have saved nothing for retirement, and there will be no one there to take care of us when we get old.  We need to get on this.

&#x200B;

**The Deets:** Currently we have no debt, and about $6k in the bank.  We have credit scores of 740+ each.  We have a combined bring-home income of approximately $70k (this can fluctuate greatly due to hubby working on commission, but we calculated a median paycheck at current job so far, and subtracted some to be conservative.) I currently make $15/hr, and average a little over $400 bring-home a week.  I will get $1 raises every six months until I hit 2 years and can get my license.  He brings home average $1200/wk, and we only count on $1000/wk just in case.  We both contribute 5% to a roth-401k with a 4% company match.  We both get the max taken out of our checks for taxes, so will likely get some sort of tax return.  We file separately. (We are not legally married... it's a long, kind of sad story).  We have put together our very first (likely very flawed) budget we intend to enact starting Oct 1st.  Our budget utilizes his income only.

&#x200B;

**The Budget:** This is our first budget, probably awful, and we're very open to input, but please give us time to work in changes as we can.

**Bills:**

Rent: $650

Utilities: $97

Phone/Internet $250 (we pay for expensive internet.. we are both avid gamers)

Car Insurance: $58

Total: $1055

&#x200B;

**Subscriptions:**

Identity Force: $37 (we both had our info stolen in the Equifax hack... we'll need identity protection the rest of our lives)

Pandora: $11

Netflix: $12

Amazon Prime $10

Total: $70

&#x200B;

**Essentials:**

Toll Tag: $120 (this might be high since we just had a come-to-jesus about not using the tollway when not absolutely necessary)

Groceries/Toiletries/Cleaning supplies: $600 (taking a stab here, no idea if this is high or low for us)

Gas: $180

Clothing: $100

Total: $1000

&#x200B;

**Luxuries:**

Video Games: $60

Dog Grooming: $55

Incidentals (unplanned expenses): $250

Date Nights: $200

Travel: $200

Total: $765

&#x200B;

**Personal Envelopes:** (An envelop each of us receives to spend as wanted/needed with no judgment from the other)

His: $150

Hers: $150

Ours (to be spent when together): $200

Total: $500

&#x200B;

**Grand Total: $3390**

&#x200B;

This budget we feel is probably too generous in some areas, and probably missing some things that will become apparent as we enact it and adjust.  Any money not spent in a particular month will either roll over up to a specific limit (incidentals, clothes, travel, etc.) or go into savings.  But, if this budget were 100% accurate, we would be able to save approximately $2210/mo.  We would LIKE to buy the house around Feb 2020.

&#x200B;

We intend to continue living on only one income as time passes.  We are only looking for as much house as his income could afford (under $200k) and are trying to save up a $15k emergency fund, and then $40k for a down payment.  I only work 4 days a week during my apprenticeship, but the days fluctuate, as do the hours on those days, so getting a second job is almost impossible.  I am toying with the idea of doing something like Uber or PostMates in my spare time, but not sure it would be worth the wear and tear on our only vehicle.  After we buy the house, we intend to rent out spare rooms and continue to live below our means and pay off the house as quickly as possible.  We are still debating whether we should get a 30 or 15 year loan.

&#x200B;

We intend to open up our own plumbing business after he or I get our Master license.  I have a possible opportunity to take an accelerated path to Master in 5 years instead of 8, which would put me less than a year behind him by the end of it.  If it works out, we might wait to open up shop under my license as I believe we get more benefits and opportunities running under my minority (female) license.  We do not intend to build an empire.  We intend to run the business until we are ready to retire, and then either replace ourselves with other plumbers in the business, or sell/dissolve the business.  We may lease out our Master licenses to Journeymen at that point for some residual income.

&#x200B;

That's all I can think of to share at the moment.  Please help us.  Offer advice or constructive criticism.  I'll update with any more necessary information.  Next post planned sometime near the beginning of November to see how month 1 went.  Also, I'm working tomorrow and about to go to bed, so please be patient for any replies from me. :)

"Quick financial background: my husband and I are doing well, but definitely aren't rich. We don't have kids (just a cat), and we make enough to pay bills, have food on the table, and have a little bit in savings (usually between $300-1,000). 

Recently I have been notified that I will be gifted $8,000. This is NOT an amount of money I want to spend or use right now. I want to save it and hopefully use it to invest in a house some day.

I don't really really need another card and I don't want to open one and not use one of those free balance transfers or ""spend $500 and get XYZ back in 3 months"" because maybe I might need one of those offers down the road and I will be ineligible because they are only for new customers.

"Like it says in the title, my car was broken into and stolen last night. I reported the theft to the police and my insurance company immediately when I found out. By the end of the day, I received a call that my vehicle was found and went to meet the officer at that location. The car was badly damaged, the ignition was stripped, the car could not be driven safely due to the damage. I had recently gotten my car detailed and there were only a couple of valuable items in the car which were no longer there after it was recovered. Not a huge deal. However, I realized towards the end of our conversation that an envelope with my insurance, registration, etc was taken from the car. I asked the officer about the implications of this and he was a little dismissive about it, which I thought was odd. These documents contain a lot of personal information that I imagine can be used for fraudulent purposes.

What precautions should I take to ensure that none of that information will be misused? I'm especially paranoid about it because my credit card information was recently stolen as well. Both of these incidents have left me feeling violated and paranoid. I've always tried to be fiscally responsible and I want very badly to prevent this from happening again. I've read that I should contact my local DMV to report the documents stolen and a credit agency to request a fraud alert, but that's all I know. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I have a question on health insurance and was hoping someone here may have experience with this. Basically, I started a job last year and got health insurance through my employer. I asked my parents to take me off of their plan, but it turns out they never did, so I've unknowingly had two health insurance policies for the last year. Google leads me to believe that with two plans, my parents' plan would have defaulted to be the ""secondary"" insurance to my employer's plan. I never filled out any forms for this to happen, but I would assume the big carriers talk to each other. Now that I have left my job, I'm wondering if my parents' insurance automatically bumps back up to be primary insurance? 

&#x200B;

I have a new job that offers good insurance but will give me a $200/month credit if I waive coverage. My parents think I should stay on their plan and earn some extra money. Can I just go ahead and waive coverage?

"I'm currently enrolled at a junior college taking mostly elective classes.

I have attended two community colleges before this one. I don't see myself living in the area of this current college much longer than a year. The way this current college is set up is that I haven't had to pay for any of my classes yet. They only require payment before enrollment in the next semester or in order to get my transcripts sent to another school. Seeing as the classes I'm currently taking are not requirements for my degree if I drop the classes I'm no longer interested in. (I am past the drop for full refund date) and continue taking the one class that I'm actually learning skills in, Finish up the semester and don't pay, what will happen? If I transfer schools to continue working on my degree somewhere else in my future. Will this come back to bight me? The reason I'm asking is I was recently offered a short term job that is more in line with my career goals then the classes I'm currently enrolled in. The payment from this job would not offset the price of paying for the classes I'd be dropping but it would benefit me in building relationships to further pursue work in that field.

"So the method I've been using is based on a lot of time I spent trying to find a good way to manage bills. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or advice. Much appreciated! 


What I Use: 
I use 2 Checking Accounts, Online Bill Pay (with my bank), an Excel Budget Spreadsheet, YNAB, and a Bill Payment Checklist. 


I have 1 checking account thats labeled ""Checking Account"" and is used for general spending money. 
The other checking account is labeled ""Bills Checking"" and is used for only paying expenses/bills. I have all my bills on bill pay/autopay. 

My Excel Budget Spreadsheet lets me enter in all my monthly expenses, irregular expenses, savings, and some other things. 
It also adds up all my monthly expenses/irregular expenses, and tells me how much I need to take out of each paycheck to leave in my ""Bills Checking"". It also will tell me how much to take out for savings or anyt other amount/percentage I want to put in a account. (Usually whatevers left I put in my Savings Account, Checking Account, retirement, etc.)

I already have a ""1 month worth of expenses buffer"" in my ""Bills Checking"" so I can put everything on Online Bill Pay/Autopay. (Money always coming in, money always going out) So the bills basically pay themselves. I don't put credit cards on autopay though, just because I feel safer paying them manually. 

I set the due dates on my bills by dividing them in half. The first half gets paid on the 1st. The other half gets paid on the 15th. (I choose the bills with the most priority to be paid on the 1st) Some bills I set to be paid a couple days early, for just in case. Every 1st & 15th I pull out the Bill Pay Checklist, make sure the bills went through, and check them off. 


On top of all that I use YNAB to help me with checkbooking, and a little bit of budgeting.
(I don't really like making a budget for everything though. I like to keep it simple and have something like 6 months worth of expenses in an emergency fund. Also a budget for car expenses, and thats about it)

"Hi R/Personalfinance,
I've been on lurking on personal finance for a while, but now that I have an income of my own I have absolutely no idea how I should be dividing up my assets. Some background: 23 years old, 50k salary, about 38k take home after taxes, union dues, pension, and such. I have 20k in college loans, 4k in savings, and 3k in stocks. I have the option of having deductions taken out to be put in a 403b or Roth 403b, and I was planning on doing it with Vanguard, but I also have the choice of AXA, Prudential, or Lincoln. 

Here's the question: I've had many people tell me to max out my 403b while I have the income to do so. I'd also like to pay off my student loan in the next 2/3 years if I can, for peace of mind, even though I know it goes against prime directives. Do I max out 403b, Roth 403b, or put in 15% and put the rest in the stock market? Further, on the application for the 403b, Vanguard asks which funds I would like my money to be put in. Is there a recommended ""more volatile"" option for young people? I could really use some guidance on what to do with the money to ensure that I have a prosperous future.

As for multi-state taxes, as far as I understand it:

If state A charges you taxes of $2,000 and state B charges you $2,500 in taxes then you would pay state A their full $2,000 and state B $500 since you get a tax credit for what you paid to state A.

Where my understanding breaks down is if this only applies to income tax, or other forms.

We live in the same household and pay our monthly bills through a joint bank account that we deposit money from (Hosted by BB&T, which is also my main bank) I can deposit straight from my account to this joint account no problem, but she has to get it from her BoA account to the joint BB&T account. 

We figured we'd use Zelle for the transferring of her money and it has worked out relatively well except for 2 transactions, on the same day as each other, from late last month that we hadn't seen until now (I understand that is something we should have noticed even the day after) BoA shows the confirmation that the money was sent but BBT does not show that it was received. She has now called  BoA but all they say is that it was supposedly returned to her account because of some issue, but from our end that money does not show up at all, anywhere.

"Ok, I'll try to keep this quick and simple.  

I had taken out a $250,000 mortgage to buy a house, I had the house for 15 months.  

The interest rate was about 4%.  

Property tax was about $5,500/year.

The monthly mortgage bill was $1800 +/- including property tax, insurance, etc.

I fell on hard times and missed 2 payments, then decided I wanted to try to do a mortgage modification program, so started on that. After a while I realized I just cannot at all afford this house anymore due to some unforeseen financial circumstances, so decides to sell it.  

All in all I had missed probably 5 or 6 payments on the mortgage before I had the funds from selling the house to pay off the mortgage.  

I end up selling the house for about $295,000.  

Now, after owning the house for just over 1 year, (15 months) and missing 5 or 6 payments total before closing on selling it, how did my pay off quote end up being $258,000?  

How did I end up having to pay $8k more than the loan was even for? I still made money on the deal, just, about $8k less than I was expecting.   

What could be the reason for that $8k amount more than what I had even got for the loan originally?  

To me, it seems like they are charging me for those payments that I had missed (less the other escrow items included in the monthly mortgage bill, so just the principle and interest on the loan, not the tax and such) but in my mind, once I paid off what the loan was for, shouldnt I not have to pay for the missed payments also?  

I just assumed after making the 9 or 10 payments I made out of 15 months, that the amount of the payoff would have gone down some, not gone up $8k.  

Any ideas? Am I just missing something? Is there some clause in some mortgage that would cause this discrepancy? How does it work?

" I am undecided what to do in the process of selling my house. I took a new position within my company that gave me a generous relocation package but I have been unable to sell my old house and I have burned through all of my relocation money in the 10 months my old house has been on the market. Currently it is under the price per sq ft average for the neighborhood that it is in and I am afraid to lower the price even further. We have had several offers that have fallen through which has added to the stress of it all.

I am hoping to recoup the original down payment (401k loan) and put the remaining equity cash into paying down debt that I have accrued during the transition. As it sits right now I would stand to net around 40k if I receive an offer at 280k where the house is listed at 290k.

I have been unable to pay down credit card debt due to the fact that I am essentially paying two mortgages and I am nearing the end of the financial line.

I am conflicted between keeping the house on the market at its current price and hoping for offers while losing money every month in order to get a large cash out, versus cutting my 10 month loss and dropping the price of the house dramatically in order to get it sold and net just enough to repay my 401k loan and start a longer process of paying down the accrued debt.

"I recently merged my small practice with a larger firm, resulting in a very nice salary and a ton of new employer-provided benefits. I have two options for health insurance: a traditional PPO, or an HDHP/HSA plan.

Annual gross household income: $200,000 (before bonuses).

With the PPO, the employer pays 100% of premiums and deductibles. This is not a typo: it is 100% free if you stay in-network, with the exception of the usual co-pays and discounted costs for prescription drugs. Nominally, there is a $5,000 yearly individual deductible, but it is paid by the employer via an HRA.

With the HDHP/HSA plan, there is a yearly deductible of $2,700. The employer contributes $2,000 per year to the HSA ($500/quarter), and I can contribute $3,450 annually. After the deductible, there is 20% coinsurance cost, with a yearly out-of-pocket maximum of $6,550.

So, my question is: Given the (virtually) completely free PPO plan, is there any reason to consider the HDHP/HSA plan? I am in my mid-30s and good health (I typically seek healthcare maybe once a year knock on wood). I understand the HSA money is triple tax advantaged, but am I correct in assuming that it’s most beneficial for someone who rarely seeks healthcare (other than OTC drugs or urgent care clinics)? Basically, you’re betting that the cost of your healthcare during the year will be less than what the employer pays into the account? 

Am I also correct in understanding that, with proper recordkeeping, I could use the HSA to reimburse myself for eligible expenses after the fact? For example, in Q1 of 2019 I have healthcare costs of $1,000. The employer provides $500 in Q1 which I use to pay for half of the $1k costs, and I pay the $500 balance for the service out of pocket. Then, when the employer provides the next $500 in Q2, I could reimburse myself that $500 from the HSA?

The rest of our money is retirement savings in tax advantaged accounts that we would not tap into.

"Just want to start a discussion on asset valuation when it comes to your personal net worth. Do you feel major assets should be valued at gross market value (to the best of your ability to estimate), or at market value less transaction fees if you were to sell? 

Real estate I think is the best example. If one hypothetically has real estate 'worth' $500k conservatively, they would not receive $500k at sale. Agent fees are significant (6% from the seller in my area). 

Investments are another example. A 401(k) may have a well defined value, but that is not the true value to the individual. Converting that to cash prior to retirement age incurs heavy fines and taxes. A standard investment (non-retirement or tax-advantageous account) will never truly be worth that market price as capital gains taxes eat you up.

I know I should open an account with vanguard, fidelity or schwab but can someone please help me figure out which one would be best for me? That is what’s making me not able to put my foot down so far. Is there any hidden fees I should watch out for? I heard some accounts you need to have more money to open up the better fund types? I am willing to do it as long as its within my means. If I can only start my roth with 5.5k in the account, can I not get access to the better funds if they cost more? I  Also would love to hear advice for our situation.

My workplace offers a 401k Roth which I max out and have set up most of my money to go there and some goes to the 401k (non-roth) portion which my company matches at 3%. Is that good? Also, I can still put 5.5k in my personal roth though right?
I also have inherited my dad’s ira and currently its being managed by a financial investor at LPL and he charges 1% annually. It has been growing steady...but of course I wonder if its really funded to the best of my interest. Should I take the reins and not have him manage the account? If so, what should I do with it? Put it in a target date fund?

My husband works two jobs currently. He works a few days of the month at his old job which most of his retirement 401k is there at Prudential. I think the options are not that great there. His full time job is at UCLA where he gets a pension and they offer a 403b there with fidelity. Should he put most of his savings into the 401k at the old place or open up the 403b and transfer it in? Or should he rollover his 401k? Regardless, I am thinking he should open up the 403b with fidelity and just opening up a roth there too.
Also, if I wanted to dabble in buying some stocks, should I do it in one one of these accounts so I don’t have tax implications?

Also, where do people stash away extra cash to let it grow more and reach FIRE? After 18k max retirement account, I’ve just been saving the extra in my savings account for when I decide to buy a house.

Sorry if that was a bit all over the place. I hope that wasn’t too much or too little info to work with. Let me know if you need any more info. Thanks in advance for all your help.

"Hello everyone,

I'm almost 23 years old and just recently opened my first credit card account through PNC (their rewards card.) 

I'm pretty new to personal finance and really didn't understand the importance of having a credit card and consequently a credit score until recently. My mom raised me with the strong belief that credit cards are ""bad"" and I should never get one. 

I understand (now) that this is a silly mindset as long as you're responsible with your finances, but because of this, I don't currently have a credit score.

I've been trying to do some research on how to quickly increase my score and I'm fine on the two basic tenants: use it frequently (but not too much!) and pay it off on time. Where I get slightly confused is the credit mix and how I can improve this percentage of the score. 

I don't have any loans or debt and my fiance and I aren't looking at buying a car or house in the near future (not in the next five years, at least.) Is there any way I can improve in this area without a loan? I apologise if I'm misunderstanding how the credit mix even works.

My question is pretty straightforward, but I just wanted you guys to know that I did try and research on my own before coming here and asking!

"PLEASE HELP. I am so lost.

In February, I got a phone call about a medical debt from an (alleged) law firm. The caller said “you are NOT YET a defendant in a lawsuit”, and then insinuated that if I did not pay them immediately; I would be sued. I tried to ask for information regarding the debt, but they continued to vaguely reference a potential lawsuit and pushed me for my credit card number.

I don’t think I handled things correctly, but I was caught off guard and afraid. I asked if they’d send me a letter validating the debt. They refused and said they had already done that. If that’s true, I honestly never received it. I’m not sure if maybe it could’ve been lost in the mail when I moved last.

Anyway, they were being rude and I was panicking, so I wanted to end the call. I asked them if they were local and if the number they called from was a good call back number. They said yes and I hung up. The number was my area code. Quick google search reveals it was a spoofed number and they’re across the country.

I googled the name of the law firm and found complaints that they are a collection agency, not an actual law firm. I pulled my credit reports and had new accounts in collections, but under a different agency. I couldn’t tell if they were the same accounts, because the caller refused to give any info.

Tried to google my rights, then I filed a complaint. I’m not sure if that was the right thing to do, but eventually I received a letter from them saying they’d closed the accounts. So I went ahead and disputed all of them on my credit report. They were all removed. I spent time building my credit from there.

Fast forward to now, credit karma sends me an email that my credit score suddenly tanked. I go to look, all those accounts were newly reported into collections. Under a THIRD agency. I have not received any communication from this new agency, no letter and no phone calls. They went straight to reporting and it wrecked my credit. Dropped it almost 100 points.

I tried disputing everything again. Equifax removed everything, but Experian said one of the accounts is “verified”. I filed another complaint. And now suddenly after I filed the complaint, this new third agency has started calling me incessantly. From several different numbers, from blocked numbers, at all hours of the day. The latest was at 9:11pm on Wednesday. Sometimes when I answer, it’s just silence and then they hang up.

What the hell do I do now? I’ve tried to figure this out on my own and I’m waaaay over my head now. Who do I contact? How do I fix this disaster? Am I just stupid for thinking this can’t be right? Sorry for the novel. I don’t even know how to condense it.

**TL;DR** - CA claimed to be law firm, threatened to sue me, then said they closed the accounts when I filed a complaint. Disputed and removed them from my credit report. Now a third agency reported the same accounts without contacting me and giving me a chance to respond before wrecking my credit score. Feels like I’m being harassed.

Few days later I was still charged for both nights on my card. I called them and they said they will refund me between 7-10 days. They did not, and I've been calling every two weeks for the past two months and the same ""resolution"" of 7-10 days comes up but I never receive any refund, or even a notification of the status of my refund.

So I just want to pay taxes on it and put the rest away assuming that I don't even own it.  I'm looking for tips on what to do.

Then I'm looking for tip son what to do next / how to invest it / save it so that it'll work for me in the future with passive income.  Any tips on this would be great.  I'm not really looking to buy a house right now, so probably not going to put it towards a down payment (housing in Seattle costs over a million dollars for something basic).

"First of all, I want to say thanks for letting me browse this community. 

After doing minimum payments on my loan for almost 7 years, reading Personal Finance gave me the kick in my ass I needed. My $40,000 (CAD) loan is now down to around 4, which I will pay off within the next month (as long as nothing comes up). 

Now, I’m already paying into my pension and I chose the “middle” plan. With my loan becoming payed off, should I put more into that monthly? 

I will also be leaving the province where I live to another one in a year or 2 and will need to pull out the pension and transfer it to Ontario. 

I had a few thousand in savings, but decided to dump it all on my loan. So right now I have very minimal savings (around 2000) for “just in case” 

Right now I’m making $94000 a year and clearing about $65 after taxes and pension. 

My rent is $60 a month (Teaching in the far North so housing is essentially paid for) and my car is paid off, so it’s just groceries that I pay for as there are no restaurants or bars or shops within about 200km of me.

At this point, I'm confident that the debt is mine. However reading the FAQ on this, I wanted to confirm its still worth sending a debt validation letter to them? I wanted to make sure that by doing so, they wont penalize me for bothering to verify the debt.

Is it also easy to ask for them to only contact me through the mail?They've already called some of my family members without disclosing the purpose of the calls but asking to get ahold of me. 

I could pay the debt by my next paycheck but would like to make sure I do everything correctly before even considering that. Is it worth calling my old apartment to verify the debt and possibly try work with them if it hasnt been fully transferred to the debt collection agency.

"Good afternoon PF. 

I own a small business that involves a lot of driving in my rather fuel inefficient box truck. I only get 9-11mpg and it takes diesel so the fuel is not cheap. I decided to see about how much fuel has cost me lately and I’m averaging around $500 a month. 

In our area we have a bunch of kroger stores with fuel centers attached. I usually shop there so I have been using my fuel point discounts on the truck fuel instead of my car because it can be a difference of $20 a tank at times. Kroger offers a credit card through MasterCard that has a promotional $.25 off per gallon for the first year every time you use your fuel points and pay with the card and after the first year it’s and extra $.05 off per gallon. 

My question is, is it worth opening another credit card just so I can save a few pennies on fuel?

No annual fee, the apr isn’t openly stated anywhere that I can find but I assume it’s over 20% like most store cards.

"This is a bit jumbled, I didn't take good notes and I was panicked yesterday so information might be all over the place.

I got a voicemail yesterday from processes server, saying they are serving me legal documents at my home or place of business by today 3-7pm. This was not a machine or recording it sounded like a legitimate person who said my full name and everything. They also called my sister and my dad with the same information. I had no idea what they could be referring to but they gave me a phone number and a case number to get more information. The man on the phone identified the company as ADR and said that in 2009 a Wells Fargo was closed due to being over drafted. This is true. He said that Wells Fargo is taking me to court and if I go to court they are going to collect 3x what the account is worth. It closed at $530, with current fees its at $830, if they take me to court they are going to seek $2500 plus lawyer fees. I told him I have never received a letter and have not heard anything about this account since 2011. I was under the impression it was all taken care of. It also does not show up on my credit report but he said it has moved past that and is currently on ChexSystems. From what I can tell this part is a legitimate reporting agency but whatever gets reported there only stays on the report for 5 years. I have request a consumer report but its going to take 5 days to mail.

I got a collections letter in 2011 and paid it for a total $1500. I do not have that paperwork. I have moved 3 or 4 times since then and consolidated poorly.

They gave me a phone number for Wells Fargo but I googled my own. I was transferred to their over draft department. I gave her all of my information and she said she does not have anything listed under my information. She said there was an account but that the account was sold in 2010. She said Wells Fargo does not sue for checking and savings accounts but that who ever owns the account may be trying to sue but that they shouldn't be advising that it is Wells Fargo.

The part of me that doesn't think it is a scam is that during that time I had a Wells Fargo Credit card and a checking account. I am not sure if what I settled in 2011 was just the credit card or both the checking account as well.

What makes me think its a scam is that one, Wells Fargo isn't suing me, two, from what I understand process servers don't call to warn you when they are serving papers (they also called my sister and dad looking for me), three, I have never received any kind of certified letter or notification that this is a problem, the call from the processes server is the first I have heard of this.

Does anyone have any advice? When it comes to old bank accounts are there different rules for essentially debt collecting? He was making it sound like its past the point of debt and that its all to do with Chexsystems and that its a legal matter now so all the standard rules are different. Also when I called them they DID NOT do the ""this is debt collection and any info is for the pursue of debt collecting"" spiel.

"Hi Guys! You all have been very helpful so far and I appreciate it. I’m fine tuning some of my tax info as I’m just really getting into my independent contractor job. I use our personal vehicle mainly for the job, but we do use it throughout the week. I just want to clarify that I am reading this right.

I’m reading over the instructions for schedule C for car expenses. Am I reading this right that you can either deduct mileage+tolls+parking if it’s a personal vehicle OR gasoline+repairs+insurance if it’s solely for company use and not personal?

I just ask because I did have to have some car repairs like brakes and a new tire (that I hit a pothole during a commute from a client’s home). And wasn’t sure if that was something that I would be able to deduct since it wasn’t something that happened during personal use.

"A year and a half ago I left my job at a tax firm to work for a private company in Acctg/IT. My market value had outgrown the company and the role I had.  I went from making 40k to 55k (currently 57k) plus benefits like profit sharing and 15k towards a masters degree.  I left on good terms with my previous job and boss.

I still do contact and consulting work for my old job.  Since I left they have tried to replacement me twice and both have left for better opportunities.  The newest person is leaving in two weeks and, if you don't know tax, the 10/15 extension deadline is coming up.  My old company is pretty desperate.

My old boss contacted me last night asking if I could work more contract hours (I can't with my main job) and she asked me how I like my new job and if it is working out.  I said it is okay but I am always open to new opportunities.  She wants to talk tomorrow.

If they make me an offer I am probably not going to ask for anything less than a 20% increase.  My old job also includes overtime vs my current is salary.  This would put me in the range of 70k plus overtime and bonuses.  Does this seem reasonable?

Also my commute would go back to an hour (right now it is 20 min).  I would probably consider moving closer and with that pay bump it would make that easier to be closer to the city vs the long commutes.

"Seattle WA, unmarried couple (2.5yrs, discussed marriage, kids, finances). Market is hot clearly, but houses are on the market like 2 weeks and prices are coming down 60-90k in some areas. Most of the houses I research were bought for \~200k before or after the recession and are selling for 500-700k now- at least the ones I'm interested in.

&#x200B;

We plan to have two kids and currently have a dog. Requirements are a fenced yard and at least an extra bedroom to start a kid and hopefully a spot for parents to crash. We're in a 700sqft apartment now with the dog and doing fine so we don't need a ton of space.

&#x200B;

We both work, I am the disproportionate earner, and we can afford a 30yr fixed mortgage on a 700k house.

&#x200B;

I have been waiting for the housing market to ""crash"" to buy. I know this is foolish, never time a market, buy when you're ready. On the other hand Seattle is just getting more crazy all the time, and some people think it'll turn into the next San Jose area where a shit-shack will still net $1MM due to influx of tech. I don't think that's the case.

I am far from the model PF poster but I put about 14% of salary into 401k, drive modest car, have my down payment saved, I'm very frugal. If we're ready to start jumping into a house should we now, and should we max out what we can afford, or should we buy the best inexpensive house. Third option is rent. Basically, should we rent homes until market cools, should we buy a 500k house on a 15 yr fixed mortgage, or buy a 700k house on a 30 yr fixed mortgage?

"I think I understand the basics about Roth vs. Traditional IRAs but please correct me if I'm wrong. Essentially, the difference is when are taxes paid on the retirement account, right? Roth = post tax money (pay taxes now and withdraw tax free at retirement) and traditional = pre tax money (pay taxes when you retire). Therefore, it is advantageous to go with a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement. Correct?  It also seems like Roth IRAs are encouraged much more than traditional on r/personalfinance.

My questions are: does that mean you're going to be at a higher tax bracket DURING retirement from your various retirement accounts? Or is it based on the tax bracket you are in just PRIOR to retirement?

Ultimately:  How could someone ever make more during retirement (be at a higher tax bracket) than when actively working?

Hypothetically, if my household income is 100,000 at age 65 and I retire, there's no way I'm going to bring in more than 100k at age 66 during retirement. Therefore, a traditional IRA would be better.

Corporate Job

Pros: 
-salary increase industry wide (resulting in field work earnings of approx $40,000-70,000)

-decent benefits, health, dental, PTO, 401k contribution

-guaranteed steady work

Cons:
-staying in hotels and traveling more

-corporate work culture

-little to no profit sharing 

Subcontracting job

Pros:
-commission on bids and storm chasing, potential daily earnings in the thousands during bad storm cleanup

-essentially self employed, payment is production based

-maximum independence

-hands on contracting experience

-the boss will provide health insurance 

-working storms and earning large amounts at a time can enable me to travel (leave of absence with a job still waiting for me is a guarantee)

Cons:
-we don't know how steady work will be at this point (it's a newer business)

-mixing family with business

"26yo. My current financial goal is to purchase a rental property. Currently own 1 home.

Stable job. 401k. Emergency savings funds. I don't NEED the money.

My mom passed away 4 years ago. My mom liked to shop... a lot. We would often go shopping for luxury items (she would buy them for me) and she collected her own items. I still have everything that she bought for me.

2 years ago my Dad made me consign all of her items that I did not want. I used a luxury consignment company (I get 70% commission) and I managed all of the work. Consigning those items ended up generating around 50K. My Dad kept all of the money (his right, since they were purchased with ""their"" money). I kept what was left.

At this time I am not interested in consigning any of the luxury handbags. However, I am considering consigning the shoes and possibly some jewelry. I am guessing that I could end up with 10K by selling a few of the items.

The issue is that these items were given to me by my mom. I will never receive another gift from my mom thus I have an obvious attachment to these items. The jewelry is tough, since I actually wear that stuff, but the shoes have been sitting for years. I am unable to wear most of them because I had foot surgery that turned my high heels into pieces of art rather than functional footwear. Yet, looking at those items makes me happy. I see many luxury items as pieces of art, not investments that will deliver a return, so it is difficult for me to let go even when the items aren't functional.

Consigning these items would put me closer to my financial goal of purchasing a rental property, but not to the point of being able to purchase a property immediately.

To give you a better idea of my savings and current status: I put 14k per year into my savings account. I put 14k per year into my 401K. I could focus more on increasing these numbers through cutting expenses in other areas of life. However, 10k is a pretty decent number when looking at the comparison to my yearly savings.

"Hello,

Quick context - I work a decent job and have been saving for a car for a bit. I have enough to put down between 2-3k on a newer used car without breaking the bank.

"Backstory: I used to work for retail company ""X"" part time making minimum. After about 3 months in I got a temporary specialist role and a 75cent raise as the person in that role went on maternity leave. During that time we lost the store manager and a department manager. Once the person on leave came back I was shifted back to a regular coworker (technically) but my actual job duties expanded as I basically filled the department manager role without the title and subsequent pay raise. This went on for about a year until we found a store manager and he was able to bring in his own people. 

I quit and accepted an offer at company ""Y"". I worked my way up to a specialist and was getting paid ~$19/hr. A leader/manager started at ~$23/hr back then. The company restructured their pay bands and I wound up getting the new starting pay of $20/hr when I became a leader/manager a couple months later. 

I have held this position for a year now and have seen that everyone else in my position is getting paid at least $22/hr and new leaders coming in to the company for the first time with prior experience are getting paid as such (in one case ~28/hr). 

I am going to ask for a raise and needed some help to further strengthen my position. If anyone knows what managers are making in the Los Angeles area at stores such as Lowes, Home Depot, Costco, Target etc. can you chime in and help me out?

"Hi All,
   
I'm 28 yrs old and I want to start investing and saving for retirement and potentially a new home in the future.
I have about 2.5 months expenses in an emergency fund. (I feel pretty secure at my job and can get another job no problem if let go)
I currently have about 4.5k in a 401k (no longer being contributed to , I switched companies and no company match at my current place)

&nbsp;

I just finished paying off a CC and now want to start paying off my car or invest in retirement/future goals.

&nbsp;

I owe ~9300 on my car. Current interest rate is 4.02%

&nbsp;

I was thinking of putting an extra $300 to it every 2 weeks on top of the monthly payment of 279.
&nbsp;

However I wanted to see if I can make that money grow elsewhere. I was thinking of transfering my 401k account to a roth IRA and start contributing a bit 
every check to it. I wanted to pay off my car first because it would just give me a better piece of mind but I wanted to do the numbers first and see if it will
be worthwhile to do something else with it.

&nbsp;

I can get the car paid off in a year or so. Or will it be more worth while to put money into some type of investment account and 
only pay the minimum. Payoff Day if paying the minimum is October 2021.

Thanks!

First of all, thank you. I've learned so much from this sub over the past few years, which has allowed me to develop healthy spending and saving habits. No debt, 30k+ in retirement, and a robust emergency fund. I'm 29.

Currently I work in higher education, but I just got my dream job with the federal government. I'll be going from making 45k in a low cost of living area (TX) to 77k in a very high cost of living area (DC). With my new job, I will not need to pay rent. No one goes into higher ed expecting to get rich, so I am having a hard time wrapping my head around my new income.

Other than avoiding lifestyle creep (already a temptation, but one that I'm confident I can control), what else should I be looking out for or thinking about when I make this transition both in salary and in location? I've already noticed that rent is much higher, as are gym membership prices, etc in DC.

"Wanted to run my analysis by you guys, bear with me here. My wife and I are purchasing our first home, we're a couple weeks from closing. Purchase price of 333k minus 4k closing costs. The appraisal came in at 342k which is pretty nice. 5% apr, $86 monthly PMI.

I ran numbers in Excel assuming home appreciation of 3.5% (we're in Portland, which has been doing 10+% the last couple years). Long story short, I ran a couple scenarios paying between $180-$500 extra on the mortgage monthly. In each scenario, we're able to get rid of PMI between 5 and 11 months earlier (after a new appraisal and hitting 80% LTV). The rate of return is ~6.5%, saving 430 to 946 in PMI by paying an extra 180-500 extra for 30 to 36 months. 

Am I right in concluding that we can earn 6% on the money by saving the PMI payments, and also earn 5% by paying down the mortgage early for a total of 11% return? If that's the case, should we prioritize that as a high interest loan for the sake of getting rid of PMI?

He mentioned that he would recommend taking out a lower interest rate personal loan (10.99% with prime) to pay off the old credit card and close that account.

Okay, so I bought my house about 2 years ago for \~$155k. With it being a desirable area that people are moving to, and the sprucing up that I've done to the place since we've moved in I think it would sell for around $170-175.

I am looking at a job offer in another city which is about 2-2.5 hours away. I am trying to negotiate my relocation package now. If they give me the package that I would like which would pay all of the closing costs and realtor fees, I think I would stay in the house for the 2 years required to not have to pay capital gains, and then sell it. My reasoning being that I would likely not buy an investment property to rent out that is 2 hours away from where I am located so it would be a good and easy opportunity to get out of it if I can get my company to pay for a lot of the costs associated with selling.

&#x200B;

However, if they don't bite and give me that relocation package...do you think I should sell it or rent it out? I really see this area growing and I think if I hold on to the property it could appreciate rather quickly compared to other areas.

So I'm not new to budgeting, but I do have a few questions and I would appreciate any and all help!

I've been using EveryDollar, and have tried other budgeting tools such as YNAB, Mint, etc., but have yet to find one that really works for me. EveryDollar is the best I've come across so far, but I feel as if I need a budgeting tool personalized to me specifically; especially because I'm paid bi-weekly, and most of these budgeting tools are monthly. (Which I have been making work to an extent, but I feel I could do better with a budget I create myself.)

Currently, Excel seems to be my best bet at creating my own, personalized budgeting tool. (If y'all have any other suggestions, I'm all ears!) The only problem is... I have no idea how Excel really works.

This is where I need you guys. I've been googling how to create bi-weekly budgets on Excel, and most of the stuff I'm finding is either too confusing, or just not what I'm looking for. I'm not sure if I'm just not understanding certain things, or if I'm looking in the wrong places, but even the pre-created templates that I've tried to download are just not very helpful. 

Here's a bit of background about my financial situation:

I'm 22 and get paid every 2 weeks. I have some credit card debts, but other than that, just the normal expenses (rent, electric, internet, cell phone bills). That's it. I do have a 401k through work, but my contributions are being automatically deducted from my paycheck before I ever see it. So no need to plan for that.

Most of the tutorials/tools I've been seeing include things I have no idea about. Such as ""dividends"", and a bunch of other unnecessary categories/sections.

All I want is to be able to plug in my income, plug in the bills I have, and then anything leftover, throw into savings. I feel like I should've found something through Google to help me do just this, but so far nothing has helped. Feel free to point me in the right direction if you know of something!

I'm sure the tutorials out there are very helpful, but everything I've found is confusing to me and a bit overwhelming. If anyone can help me get a start with this, that would be greatly appreciated!

Also, if this isn't the right place for this, let me know and I can try a different sub. Wasn't really sure where else to go with this post.

**My question: Do I refinance my home to pull out $70,000 in equity so that I can consolidate debt?** The mortgage company has called and is encouraging me to give up my 3.375% APR for a 5.5% APR. The loan is currently $92,000ish and the houses in the neighborhood are selling around $200,000.

My situation. My credit score per Transunion is hovering around 611, IDNotify implies it is a 729 (I doubt it), and one of my credit cards claims the FICO is 661. I am 49 years old. Two years ago I was budgeting and winning. Then I slipped and got away from budgeting and lived in the red. I am no longer abusing the credit cards but have accumulated debt that is making it difficult to live. I have to pull in an additional $2000 per month through side work just to keep food on the table.

I earn $80,786 annually before taxes et al.  Net pay is $5292 monthly. Additionally, I 1099 roughly $2000 per month (varies of course). I save nothing. I spend a fortune in interest. I currently have just above $1000 in the bank. I am continuing to adjust the budget and remove unnecessary expenses.

As you can can see there isn't much room to help put more towards any of the higher APR CCs. I'm thinking that the next best thing is getting a personal loan to pay all of the CC debt off and then manage one overall loan for them.
There were preapproved offers that came in the mail but I'm very inexperienced (and skeptical) when it comes to the validity of such offers:

1.  Credit9 (Loans originate from Americor Funding): 
0% for 12 months then 12%-25% thereafter / no collateral / no upfront fees
2. Greenlink Financial:
""Flexible personal loan"" / no collateral / Rate = 5.49% for Debt balance up to $25000
3. National Debt Relieft
4. Signature One

I've also heard of Lending Club but I'm not sure if they are legit.
Is our best path forward for immediate help going to be a personal loan? If so, would one of the above help? Are there other lenders and/or options that would be better?

"I’m currently making about $50k a year and living with Mom and Dad until I can move out. My savings are currently $10k at a fair interest rate of 1.5% and I have no loan or credit debt of any kind (only monthly car payments on a lease). 

I know the general rule is to not spend savings in case there is a medical emergency, but I’m wondering if getting corrective laser eye surgery could actually be worth dipping in to savings in order to dial back on all my glasses/contact lenses expenses. I have terrible vision. Like, we’re talking  “can’t see six inches from my face” bad. 

After doing the numbers with exam appointment costs and contact lenses, I probably spend about $350 a year on eye care. The surgery to correct my vision would be $4.7k, and I’m luckily young enough where I can take advantage of my “young eyes” for the maximum amount of time possible. Over the course of the 13 years I have until I’m 40 (when old age might require me to wear reading glasses), I would hypothetically be saving $4.5k in total thanks to all the eye care I wouldn’t be needing anymore. 

While there is financing for surgeries like this, I’ve always thought that it might be a better long term benefit to my wallet if I paid lump sum out of savings than incur interest by going into a line of credit again. 

So is it worth even doing a surgery like this at this time? If no, why not? If yes, what would be the smartest way to pay? Should I just wait for another time when I might have those kinds of disposable funds in the future?

They asked me to get another brand car (local brand) worth $50,000 or get a completely new car of the same brand and make costing about $75,000 as I can take loan for the car.

"Some background; I grew up financially poor. As a teenager, I remember looking at my single-mother's tax returns for one year when I was a kid and being surprised that she had only made about $13,000. She'd make pupusas (typical Salvadoran food) and sell them for $1.50 in our local grocery's parking lot from the trunk of her car. I also remember walking along the train tracks behind our house looking for discarded aluminum beer cans so we could redeem for a couple cents. Although I always had food, clothes and a roof over my head, I now realize money was always tight. For a while, none of us had a bed so my siblings, my mom and I would simply roll out blankets on our bedroom floor and sleep in makeshift sleeping pads. Each morning we'd roll them up against the wall so we could move around the bedroom without having to step on where we slept. We could never afford vacations or a nice car or even a nice meal. In fact, going out to McDonald's as a family was a treat.

&#x200B;

I'm now 30 working at a stable job that doesn't pay much, but benefits are good and I've been conscious of keeping my expenses down as much as I can. Except for emergencies, I haven't used a credit card in years and hope to finally be credit card debt free by the end of the year. I squirrel away 5% of my paycheck into my 401(K) while I try to save up as much as I can into a--at minimum--$3,000 emergency savings fund.

&#x200B;

Every month I have the blessing of having at least $100 of play money that I can use for whatever I want, yet I still feel hesitant to part with it and find myself nickle-and-diming everything I buy for myself or others trying to keep costs at a minimum. The financial blue print that I inherited from how I was raised prevents me from truly enjoying what I receive as well as giving without any remorse. How can I change that?

&#x200B;

Without having to get too woo-woo, I sincerely believe that money is energy and the more I give credence to this financial blue print from childhood, the less I'm open to the abundance that I'd like to receive.

&#x200B;

Are there any books or YouTube videos that anyone can recommend to help me shift my perception of money from one laden with want and fear to one full of abundance and possibility?

I work for a precision aerospace company. I was hired on as a support worker fulfilling tickets at $12/hr. I've been at my position for about 5 months. In that 5 months I have moved from just doing tickets to managing the ticket network, being a part of the engineering ticket network, and now I am in charge of all the PPAP documentation (consists of bubbling prints, creating inspection documentation, and special documentation depending on certain clauses of the customer). I feel like I have gained a considerably amount of responsibility and workload from when I was initially hired. And I believe that should merit a raise.

The only thing that I see as an issue is that my father was in dying in the ICU for approximately 30 days (thankfully he survived) but during that time I had a decent amount of absences since I'm his only family and next of kin. I also have Ulcerative Colitis and was hospitalized overnight, missing a total of 2 days which put me over the limit for days missed and got a written warning because of it.

"Hey folks,

&#x200B;

I was hoping you could provide your opinions on my current car insurance with Esurance, and whether or not it's worth it to drop my comprehensive or collision coverage.

&#x200B;

I currently drive a 2010 Mazda 3, valued at about 5.5k. My coverage is as follows:

&#x200B;

**Limits**

Bodily Injury Limits: $100,000/$300,000

Property Damage Limit: $50,000

PIP - Medical Coverage: $20,000/$100 deductible

PIP Economic Limits: $20,000/$200 deductible

Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury Limits: $50,000/$100,000

&#x200B;

**Coverage**

Comprehensive Coverage & Deductibles: $500

Collision Coverage & Deductibles: $500

&#x200B;

I pay at 6-month intervals at $591, for a monthly insurance of $98.50. Dropping both comprehensive and collision reduces the 6-month total to $345, or $57.50 monthly. I've got a decent amount in emergency savings where if something awful happened to my car, I would be able to purchase a similar used car. Winter **is** just around the corner as well, so I'm a little concerned about that.

"Hi personal finance folks!

To start, I'm the 25yo adult-child of a financially clueless parent so a lot of what I know I've learned here and other internet research.

My credit is in good standing 740+ (was higher, but opening all these new accounts around the same time pulled credit hits), I have a newly purchased car loan in my name, car insurance payment, an apartment I'm renting, utilities in my name, one credit card with a low balance, one credit card almost paid off, and student loans that are in deferment. 

That said:

Does it make sense to pay my bills ahead?

I've paid my car note 2 months ahead so far and try to make payments more frequently on my credit card and utilities. The credit cards obviously don't count as paying ahead, but it is paying it off faster. The utilities do build 'credits' so if for some awful reason something happened, I'd have X amount of money already paid that they could draw from. 

I don't feel underwater or stressed by my payments, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. 

Also, I have a small savings cushion as well that can cover my rent in case something were to happen.

Does this make sense to do? Is there any real benefit to paying bills ahead? I have a lot of fear about financial insecurity and missing bills so I'm trying to find a balance.

"tl;dr - I am quite literally supporting my boyfriend financially and he doesn't understand the severity of the situation he has put me in.

Right now I am feeling as though I am in a financial bind, and I am not sure how to resolve this situation tactfully. Ever since I moved out at 21, I handled all the bills for whoever I lived with. This was mainly because the lease had always been in my name and in turn, all the utilities. I would pay the bill, and whoever I was living with would pay me back or ahead of time. Perhaps I was lucky, but this had never been a problem.

My boyfriend moved in with me in February, and I have since purchased house which is in my name alone. As mentioned before, I pay the bills and he is \*supposed\* to reimburse me, and lately I feeling as though he is taking my flexibility for granted because he knows I am not going to miss a payment. In the last couple of months he has grown very lax regarding paying me and tells me he feels uncomfortable always talking about finances, but I am now struggling as a result of him. At first I would Venmo request him and those piled up. We ended up sitting down and having a very serious talk about this. We agreed that he would pay me a minimum amount each month, and any extra goes towards his balance owed to me from previous bills, groceries, vacations, etc. I asked that he also get a part time job given he owes me a significant amount of money. He was resistant to doing this, but eventually agreed (although I don't even foresee this happening).

We are two weeks into this agreement and he has paid me just about a quarter of that is owed for the month and knowing what he makes weekly, there is no way he is going to be able to pay the remaining amount. My finances are suffering significantly and I have had to dip into my savings account a number of times recently to cover his half of the bills, which is now down $4K to cover his half of things. I expressed my concern and he says things like ""At least you have a savings account."" and most recently stated that if I am in that much of bind that there has to be something wrong on my end from a budgeting perspective. I am not sure what I can do to show him that I am in this bind as a result of his irresponsibility.

I fear he is not taking this seriously and I need to figure out a way to penalize him for not making a payment whether that be charging an interest rate or late fee. Without this he is going to continue to take his time, but adamantly disagrees to this because obviously he doesn't want to owe me more than he already does. I am not sure what to do to make this fair without literally managing his finances personally (which I wouldn't want to do for another adult).",28,1536966624.0,personalfinance,9fssxx,6,Financial bind from covering all the bills,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9fssxx/financial_bind_from_covering_all_the_bills/

"My spouse and I have been saving aggressively for a down payment on our first home. We're in a situation where we'll have enough for 10% down in a year or 20% down in two years. I ran the numbers and was pretty shocked at the difference in costs and equity between the two. Here's the basic breakdown of the cost differences at the point we could get PMI removed in a 10% down payment scenario:

House Cost: $400,000 (3 br. townhome in HCOL)

**10% Scenario (PMI removed 9/2025):**

* Total ""lost"" money (1 year rent, interest, PMI) = $124,728.80 

* Total equity = $80,345.17 

**20% Scenario (status at 9/2025):**

* Total ""lost"" money (2 years rent, interest) = $105,164.73 

* Total equity = $109,351.64

Despite the extra year of rent adding to the overall ""lost"" money, we still come out with $48,570.54 *more* if we wait until a 20% vs. 10% down payment.

I then considered, what if we over-payed on rent to get rid of the PMI faster? I ran the numbers again figuring an extra $500 per month into our hypothetical mortgage payment and found:

**10% Scenario (PMI removed 10/2022):**

* Total ""lost"" money (1 year rent, interest, PMI) = $73,711.79 

* Total equity = $80,824.83 

**20% Scenario (status at 10/2022):**

* Total ""lost"" money (2 years rent, interest) = $37,585.25 

* Total equity = $81,268.93 

In this scenario, the extra payments work out to nearly the same equity-wise, but we wind up paying nearly twice as much ""lost"" money, with a difference of $36,570.64 in favor of the 20% down scenario.

Obviously, there are some factors that can tweak these numbers one way or the other, such as rising/falling interest rates, rents, and home values; the opportunity cost of not being able to invest money in the 10% scenarios that require higher monthly payments; and the financial and psychological costs of the higher DTI and lower monthly liquidity that comes with the 10% down scenarios.

I can't speak for others and their given situations, but for my spouse and I, waiting until we have the 20% will likely save a significant amount of money in the short term and lot of money in the long term.",32,1536964438.0,personalfinance,9fsi2x,6,Waiting until you have saved 20% down when buying a house is sooo important for your financial health.,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9fsi2x/waiting_until_you_have_saved_20_down_when_buying/

"Was reading online about advantages/disadvantages of paying off my mortgage (year 3 of 30) early over the next 4-5 years.  Came across the following:

> Mortgage interest is calculated differently from interest on other items (like credit cards). Essentially, the majority of your first monthly payment is interest, while the last payment is mostly principal. Each regular monthly payment you make applies to the next payment due, and any extra payment applies to the last payment due.

> For example, assume you have a 30-year mortgage with a monthly payment of $2,000. Your first payment includes about $360 in principal and $1,640 in interest, while the last payment includes about $60 in interest and $1,940 in principal. If you made a double payment of $4,000 (to “save” on interest), all you’re saving is $60, and that’s 30 years from now. Put another way, it’s a return of less than 0.1% per year.

This can't be right, can it? Why would anyone ever pay off a mortgage early if occasional extra payments were essentially worthless?",26,1536962070.0,personalfinance,9fs6pg,1,Paying off Mortgage Early,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9fs6pg/paying_off_mortgage_early/

"I had an idea and I wanted your opinion about it.

I have had a savings account for some time with 3% yearly interest. The interest is calculated per day but is paid at the end of the month (I know this for sure). I have some money in it, but not as much as I would like to have.

I use my debit card whenever I can, and I like it that way as I am better at it then with cash, as I get an SMS with how much exactly is spent.
Some time ago I realised that my bank offers a credit card that only has late payment charges (with 22% interest).

So my idea is this, I put my salary in the saving account and use the credit card instead of the debit card and only pay what I owe, and the rest will stay on the saving account. That way I think I will save more and the money will literally create more money.

"This has probably been asked before.
 
I got my first credit card last month and I've been relying on it heavily to help me get through a month and a half with no pay from my teaching jobs.  My first check came today and I have four more paychecks coming within the next two weeks. 

I racked up ~$800 in credit card charges, and they were mostly gas, groceries, and paying a few bills.  Now that I'm getting paid again, I've decided that I want to make an aggressive debt paydown plan because I don't like having this kind of debt! I plan to use my CC as little as possible after this.

I got my first statement from the CC company earlier this month and my balance due was ~$420.  Since then I've spent another $400 so my current balance is now ~$800 and the bill is due at the beginning of October.

My question is this: do I only need to pay the $420, or do I pay the whole balance (~$800)?  Also, should I pay down the balance or $0, or should I leave $10-15 on the card for when my CC company sends it report to the credit bureaus? My credit score dropped due to heavy utilization so I want to get it up again.

To be honest I plan to pay down the whole balance because I want to get rid of this debt as soon as possible, but I guess the real question is whether to pay it to zero or leave something on it.
